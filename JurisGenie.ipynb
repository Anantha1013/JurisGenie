Sir Charles was found dead on the moors, with an expression of terror on his face and footprints of a large hound nearby. Following his death, Sir Charles's heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada, fearing for his life due to the family curse.\n","\n","Holmes and Watson set out to uncover the truth. They investigate the moor, meet various characters—including the enigmatic housekeeper Mrs. Barrymore—and uncover clues that suggest a more earthly explanation for the haunting. The climax reveals that the supposed supernatural hound is, in fact, a trained dog used to scare Sir Charles and Sir Henry.\n","\n","In the end, Holmes solves the mystery, revealing the true villain and clearing the Baskerville name, showcasing his brilliant deductive reasoning throughout.

None\n","What is the effect of the expression “… subject to any\n","     limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to\n","     mineral development” on the taxing power of the State\n","     Legislature in List II Entry 50, particularly in view of its\n","     uniqueness in the sense that it is the only entry in all the\n","     entries in the three Lists (Lists I, II and III) where the taxing\n","     power of the State Legislature has been subjected to “any\n","     limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to\n","     mineral development”?.”\n","\n","\n","     That     is   how     the     questions      have   been   placed    for\n","\n","consideration of this nine-judge Bench.5. As\n","\n","already noted, Entry 50 - List II is a taxation Entry which\n","\n","empowers a State Legislature to impose tax on mineral rights. However, this power of the State Government is not an absolute\n","\n","power inasmuch as Entry 50 - List II itself states that the power\n","\n","of the State Legislature to impose tax on mineral right is\n","\n","“subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law\n","\n","relating to mineral development”. In other words, if there is any\n","\n","limitation imposed by the Parliament by law relating to mineral\n","\n","development then that would have an impact on the legislative\n","\n","competence of the State Legislature to impose a tax on mineral\n","\n","rights. The key expressions of Entry 50 - List II are “taxes on\n","\n","mineral rights” and “subject to any limitations imposed by the\n","\n","Parliament by any law on mineral development”. Thus, while Entry 50 - List II speaks of\n","\n","taxes on mineral rights and is a taxation Entry empowering\n","\n","States to impose taxes on mineral rights, the same is not\n","\n","unbridled or absolute but is subject to any limitation to be\n","\n","imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development. In other words, if Parliament intends to regulate mineral\n","\n","development in the country, it can do so by a law made as per\n","\n","Entry 54 - List I and to that extent the taxation Entry in Entry\n","\n","50 - List II could be limited and the State’s right to impose a tax\n","\n","on mineral rights by a law would be affected. Thus, a taxation\n","\n","Entry in Entry 50 - List II can be affected by Entry 54 - List I in\n","\n","the interest of mineral development by Parliament imposing a\n","\n","limitation on the State’s right to tax mineral rights. Hence, the framers of the\n","\n","Constitution introduced Entry 50 - List I enabling a limitation\n","\n","being imposed on Entry 50 - List II although that is a taxation\n","\n","Entry giving powers to the States to impose taxes on mineral\n","\n","rights. It is subject to any limitation imposed by Parliament\n","\n","under Entry 54 - List I. Thus, any aspect of regulation\n","\n","of mines and mineral development taken under the control of\n","\n","the Union by a declaration made by the Parliament by a law,\n","\n","denudes the State Legislature of its legislative competence to\n","\n","pass any law to that extent. Page 27 of 193MMDR Act, 1957is enacted and deals with certain aspects of\n","\n","mineral development, to that extent the State Legislature would\n","\n","be denuded of its competence to pass any law on the said\n","\n","aspect. The legislative competence vested with the State\n","\n","Legislature is, therefore, not an absolute one but is subject to a\n","\n","Parliamentary law enacted as per Entry 54 - List I dealing with\n","\n","mineral development.10. Having analysed the relevant constitutional Entries which\n","\n","have a bearing on the controversy, it is necessary to refer to the\n","\n","scheme of and salient provisions of theMMDR Act, 1957which\n","\n","has been enacted by Parliament pursuant to Entry 54 - List I. That, insofar as ‘minor\n","\n","minerals’     are     concerned,          the   State   Governments       were\n","\n","authorised to make rules for regulation of grant of prospective\n","\n","licenses and mining leases and for purposes connected\n","\n","therewith and it is also a delegated authority given to the State\n","\n","Government and not the State Legislature.16.2     Taking into consideration Entry 50 - List II, which deals\n","\n","with taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitation imposed\n","\n","by the Parliament by law relating to mineral development, it was\n","\n","observed that in view of the limitation imposed by the\n","\n","Parliament under theMMDR Act, 1957, it was doubtful if anyCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Page 86 of 193legislative competency has been left for the State Legislature to\n","\n","impose any tax on mineral rights. In the said case it was observed that on a combined\n","\n","reading of Entries 23 and 50 - List II and Entry 54 - List I it\n","\n","established that as long as the Parliament did not make any\n","\n","law in exercise of its power under Entry 54 - List I the powers of\n","\n","the State Legislature in Entries 23 and 50 - List II would be\n","\n","exercisable by the State Legislature. Page 88 of 193such declaration is made, such regulation and development is\n","\n","undertaken by law made by Parliament and the powers of the\n","\n","State Legislature under Entries 23 and 50 - List II are denuded. It was further contended that\n","\n","Entry 50 – List II of the same list authorised the State\n","\n","Legislature to levy tax on mineral rights subject to any\n","\n","limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral\n","\n","development.Civil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Page 94 of 193provision was unauthorised and was set aside as there was no\n","\n","power vested under Entry 50 – List II after the enforcement ofMMDR Act, 1957. This was becauseSection 9was a limitation\n","\n","imposed by Parliament on Entry 50 – List II.17.6     This judgment is instructive inasmuch as it put into\n","\n","perspective what was required to be decided, i.e. This is because Entry 52 –\n","\n","List I does not impose any limitation on Entry 49 – List II and if\n","\n","the tax on exercise of mineral right squarely falls within the\n","\n","ambit of Entry 50 – List II then the limitation in the context of\n","\n","Entry 54 – List I would have to be borne in mind before the\n","\n","State can embark upon levying any further tax on the basis of\n","\n","royalty as a measure.Civil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. In my opinion, it would be incongruous with\n","\n","the constitutional intent to hold that the conscious provision\n","\n","for Union supremacy through the insertion of aforesaid\n","\n","apparatus, specifically through insertion of Entry 50 – List II,\n","\n","denudes the States’ power to use mineral rights or royalty\n","\n","levied upon them as a measure to tax land. To do so would\n","\n","simply render Entry 50 – List II nugatory.Kesoram:26.14     I do not find any inconsistency between the judgments\n","\n","in Kannadasan and Tata Iron and Steel on the questions of\n","\n","whether royalty is a tax and whether the States had no\n","\n","competency to levy any tax on exercise of mineral rights. Therefore, it was observed that the word “lands” in Entry 49 -\n","\n","List II cannot include mineral bearing lands. In this connection,\n","\n","it was further observed that the extent to which regulation of\n","\n","mines and mineral development under the control of the Union\n","\n","is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public\n","\n","interest (Entry 54 – List I), must be noted as, to that extent,\n","\n","denuding the State Legislation of its power under Entry 50 -\n","\n","List II. Such a limitation cannot operate on Entry 49 - List\n","\n","II because there is no specific stipulation under the Constitution\n","\n","to that effect. The Constitution\n","\n","envisages the imposition of limitations by Parliament on the\n","\n","legislative field of the state of taxes on mineral rights, and not\n","\n","taxes on lands … Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\n","\n","doctrine of generalia specialibus non derogant has no application\n","\n","in the instant case because Entries 49 and 50 of List operate in\n","\n","different fields” in my view is contrary to what has been\n","\n","reasoned by the seven-judge Bench in India Cement and also\n","\n","the scheme of Entry 54 - List I and Entries 23 and 50 - List II\n","\n","as well as the object, intent and scheme of Parliament in\n","\n","making a declaration underSection 2of the MMDR Act, 1957. Further, the Validation Act passed by the Parliament on the\n","\n","strength of Entry 54 – List I would have been wholly\n","\n","unnecessary if Entry 49 – List II was applicable to mineral\n","\n","bearing lands.33. Taxes on\n","\n","lands and buildings would include taxes on agricultural land,\n","\n","non-agricultural land, etc. In other words, there\n","\n","          cannot be a tax on mineral bearing land twice over\n","\n","          by the State Government: one, under Entry 49 -\n","\n","          List II as land per se and another, under Entry 50 -\n","\n","          List II which is subject to any limitation being\n","\n","          made by Parliament by law i.e.MMDR Act, 1957Civil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Page 162 of 193made pursuant to Entry 50 - List I and more\n","\n","          particularly,Section 2read withSection 9of the\n","\n","          said Act. If, for instance,Section 9of the MMDR\n","\n","          Act, 1957 is repealed and the Parliament leaves it\n","\n","          to the wisdom of State legislatures to impose\n","\n","          royalty, then, there cannot be a duplication of\n","\n","          taxes on mineral bearing land: one under Entry 49- List II and another under Entry 50 - List II. Page 163 of 193word “lands” under Entry 49 - List II cannot include mineral\n","\n","bearing land as well. This would amount to “double taxation” so\n","\n","to say imposed by two different Legislatures: one, by the State\n","\n","Legislature on the mineral bearing land under Entry 49 - List II\n","\n","and again for conducting a mining operation which is for\n","\n","exercise of a mineral right underSection 9of MMDR Act, 1957,\n","\n","which     is   a   Parliamentary          law   also   paid   to   the   State\n","\n","Government. Hence, the State Legislature using royalty\n","\n","on mineral produce as a measure to impose a cess under Entry\n","\n","49 - List II on mineral bearing land would indeed overlap Entry\n","\n","50 - List II. This is because minerals are extracted by virtue of\n","\n","mining activity which is in exercise of a mineral right and taxes\n","\n","on mineral rights are envisaged under Entry 50 – List II subject\n","\n","to any limitation imposed by the Parliament. Page 164 of 193the form ofMMDR Act, 1957and the rules made thereunder\n","\n","which would be a limitation on the power of the State to tax\n","\n","under Entry 50 – List II. Consequently, all States would once again start levying taxes\n","\n","on mineral rights under Entry 49 - List II and thereby bypass\n","\n","Entry 50 - List II so as to not be bound by any limitation that\n","\n","the Parliament had imposed by law on the power of the States\n","\n","to levy taxes on mineral rights. Although,\n","\n","Entry 50 – List II is a taxing Entry, it will be subject to the\n","\n","limitations enacted by the Parliament by law under Entry 54 –\n","\n","List I. The answer to the question raised by learned Solicitor\n","\n","General, whether the States can impose levies under Entry 50 –\n","\n","List II over and above the amount of royalty received by them\n","\n","under theMMDR Act, 1957, is in the negative. The submission\n","\n","that Entry 50 – List II is sui generis because it is the only\n","\n","legislative Entry which limits the taxing powers of the State\n","\n","legislatures by reference to a general law, is a correct\n","\n","submission made by Sri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel.Civil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc.

Chief     Justice      of   India   Dr     Dhananjaya    Y\n","\n","Chandrachud on the questions referred to this nine-judge\n","\n","Bench. I\n","\n","propose to discuss in detail the reasons for the aforesaid view.Does the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)\n","    Act, 1957contain any provision which operates as a\n","    limitation on the field of legislation prescribed in List II\n","    Entry 50 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of\n","    India? On enumerating the questions for opinion of this nine-\n","\n","judge Bench, five issues have been encapsulated in paragraph\n","\n","5 of the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of India which\n","\n","read as under:d. What is the scope of Entry 49 of List II and whether\n","             it covers a tax which involves a measure based on\n","             the value of the produce of land? As the learned Chief Justice has recorded the submissions\n","\n","of the respective parties in detail, I need not be repetitive except\n","\n","highlighting the fact that the learned senior counsel and\n","\n","counsel for the appellants have contended that “royalty is not aCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Thus, in substance\n","\n","the taxing power can be derived only from a specific taxing\n","\n","Entry in an appropriate List. Therefore, it is necessary\n","\n","to consider the facts and the reasoning in India Cement. Reference was made to the judgment of the Mysore High\n","\n","Court     in     Laxminarayana            Mining    Co.   authored     by\n","\n","Venkataramiah, J. (as His Lordship then was), in India\n","\n","Cement. The aforesaid reasoning would not apply to\n","\n","the present case. Even\n","\n","though the subject mineral rights are part of the State List,\n","\n","taxes on mineral rights are treated separately and hence, the\n","\n","principle that the specific excluded the general must be applied. In view of the above, the reasoning in the proposed\n","\n","judgment of the learned Chief Justice of India, in paragraph\n","\n","339 that “though Parliament can limit the taxing field entrusted\n","\n","to the State under Entry 50 - List II through a law relating to\n","\n","mineral development, the limitation operates on the field of taxing\n","\n","mineral rights. Effect of Overruling India Cement:35.3      At this juncture, I must also observe the overruling the\n","\n","judgment in India Cement would mean that all judgments\n","\n","which are akin to the ratio of India Cement whether prior to or\n","\n","subsequent thereto, stand overruled irrespective of whether\n","\n","they are the judgments of the High Courts or this Court. Resolved to study and reform the existing arrangements\n","\n","between the Union and the States in an evolving socio-\n","\n","economic scenario, the Ministry of Home Affairs vide Order\n","\n","dated    09.06.1983        constituted    a   Commission   under      the\n","\n","Chairmanship of Justice R.S. What follows are my answers to the conclusions reached\n","\n","on the issues raised in the judgment of Hon’ble the Chief\n","\n","Justice of India, which read as under:withSection 15(1)of the   of the MMDR Act, 1957 isMMDR Act? In view of the above discussion, the eleven questions\n","\n","referred to this Bench are accordingly answered. Page 192 of 193I must place on record my sincere appreciation to the\n","\n","learned Attorney General, learned Solicitor General and their\n","\n","teams, learned senior counsel appearing for the respective\n","\n","parties, learned instructing counsel and learned counsel for the\n","\n","respective parties for their valuable assistance to this Bench.………………………………J.\n","384\n","[-0.06494265,

-0.11208645]\n","------------------------------------------------------------\n","Hi None\n","What is the true nature of royalty/dead rent payable on\n","    minerals produced/mined/extracted from mines?6. Therefore, the question which arises is, whether,\n","\n","payment made for exercise of mineral rights being royalty, is a\n","\n","tax or an exaction.8.Article 265of the Constitution mandates that no tax shall\n","\n","be levied or collected except by authority of law.Article 366is a\n","\n","definition clause and it states that in the Constitution, unless\n","\n","the context otherwise requires, the expressions mentioned\n","\n","therein have the meanings thereby respectively assigned to\n","\n","them. Dead rent is to be paid for such area included in the\n","\n","instrument of lease. Page 38 of 193either dead rent or royalty, whichever is greater. However, dead\n","\n","rent is payable for such area covered under the instrument of\n","\n","lease, on an annual basis, regardless of whether any mining\n","\n","activity is undertaken on such land.The Third Schedule to the\n","\n","Actprescribes the dead rent payable per hectare, per annum. If payment of\n","\n","royalty, which is a consideration for exercise of mineral rights is\n","\n","expressly covered underSection 9of the MMDR Act, 1957, can\n","\n","the same be a basis for any other exaction by a State either by\n","\n","imposing another tax/cess based on royalty or by imposing any\n","\n","other tax on mineral bearing land? As noted above, royalty is a\n","\n","consideration imposed by a lessor on a lessee of a mining lease\n","\n","for the grant of the mining lease, which in sum and substance\n","\n","is a requisite consideration for exercise of a mineral right. Therefore, it is in the interest of mineral\n","\n","development that a lessor is bound to collect royalty and dead\n","\n","rent from a lessee in terms of what is envisaged inSections 9and9Aread withSecond Schedule to the Act. Therefore, payment of royalty on a mining activity\n","\n","in exercise of a mineral right was construed to be “land\n","\n","revenue” and the basis for imposing a local cess. It is a payment made to the\n","\n","land owner by the lessee of the mine, in return of the privilege of\n","\n","working which is different from rent. Every     facet\n","\n","concerning minerals, whether it be taxation, regulation, or\n","\n","development, is without an iota of doubt an important question\n","\n","of national concern for, it has ramifications on the stability of\n","\n","national economy, environmental degradation, labour laws,\n","\n","rights of tribal communities, etc. on mineral rights. Entry 49 - List II does not apply to\n","\n","          mineral bearing lands as such lands are taxed in\n","\n","          the form of royalty or dead rent in the context of\n","\n","          exercise of mineral rights. Exercise of mineral\n","\n","          rights is the basis for payment of royalty or dead\n","\n","          rent.\n","384\n","[-0.052008677, 0.03135095, 0.017453818, -0.023034249, -0.005114958,

Therefore, as such, there cannot be a conflict of\n","\n","taxation power of the Union and the State. Since royalty is\n","\n","payable on ad valorem basis, the holder of a mining lease would\n","\n","be liable to pay the same only depending on the value of the\n","\n","mineral won/removed/consumed. For the aforesaid\n","\n","reasons, I hold that royalty is the nature of a tax or an exaction.Hingir-Rampur:12.2     Thus, the scheme of Orissa Act, which was a 1952 Act,\n","\n","was considered in juxtaposition of theMMDR Act, 1957, also\n","\n","called as ‘Central Act’. The payment\n","\n","of cess was in addition to payment of royalty under the\n","\n","provisions of theMMDR Act, 1957, which is a Central\n","\n","enactment. Page 80 of 193the price of minerals extracted in the State of Tamil Nadu over\n","\n","and above what is otherwise the price that could be fixed which\n","\n","would include, inter alia, only the royalty charges. This\n","\n","is not in the interest of mineral development as this would lead\n","\n","to every State imposing local cesses/imposts/tax on the\n","\n","minerals extracted in the respective States over and above\n","\n","royalty payable under theMMDR Act, 1957which is a\n","\n","structured levy in the form of a tax to be determined only by the\n","\n","Central Government in order to maintain uniformity in the\n","\n","price of a mineral extracted throughout the country. Page 81 of 193the scheme of the said Act which envisages only payment of\n","\n","royalty on the minerals extracted.Laddu Mal:16. Royalty is a levy in\n","\n","proportion to the minerals worked. Page 158 of 193is concerned, there cannot be a tax on such land per se to be\n","\n","levied by the State Legislature as well as tax on mineral rights\n","\n","exercised on such land which is based on the value of the\n","\n","minerals produced under a Central Act. (v) Fifthly, to reiterate, when the value of minerals\n","\n","          extracted is the basis of payment of royalty under\n","\n","          the scheme of theMMDR Act, 1957, which is a\n","\n","          Parliamentary legislation, such land cannot be\n","\n","          construed to be falling within the scope and ambit\n","\n","          of Entry 49 - List II also so as to be subjected to a\n","\n","          tax imposed by the State. Therefore, royalty cannot also be a measure to impose tax on\n","\n","mineral bearing land. The circle would come around\n","\n","when Parliament would have to again step in to bring about a\n","\n","uniformity in the prices of minerals and in the interest of\n","\n","mineral development so as to curb the States from imposing\n","\n","levies, taxes, etc. Parochial considerations must yield to the larger interests of\n","    the nation in such matters.”\n","\n","\n","    However, till the above situation is achieved constitutional\n","\n","courts would have to adjudicate by way of judicial review. Therefore, it is only Union legislation\n","\n","which can ensure the same successfully. Therefore, the Act itself has to be construed as a\n","\n","limitation on the power of the States to demand or impose\n","\n","levies to the extent to which is stated in the Act. To read it\n","\n","otherwise would lead to destruction of the federal balance, as\n","\n","rightly contended by Sri Salve. 39.2     Consequently, the contention of learned senior counsel\n","\n","Sri Rakesh Dwivedi for the appellants-States to the effect that\n","\n","value of the minerals could be used as a measure to tax mineral\n","\n","bearing land under Entry 49 – List II cannot be accepted. scope and ambit ofArticle\n","                                           366(28)of      the\n","                                           Constitution          which\n","                                           defines taxation to include\n","                                           the imposition of any tax\n","                                           or      impost,     whether\n","                                           general or local or special\n","                                           and the word “tax” is to be\n","                                           construed accordingly.b.

Mahanadi Coalfields ..................................................... 10015. Goodricke ..................................................................... 10116. Kannadasan ................................................................. 12418. I respectfully dissent with the said opinion and express\n","\n","my reasons therefor.1.1     The sum and substance of all the questions referred to\n","\n","this Bench could be crystallised to the short point for\n","\n","consideration, namely, whether royalty as envisaged underSection 9of the Mines and Minerals (Development and\n","\n","Regulation) Act, 1957 (for short “MMDR Act, 1957”) is a tax or\n","\n","an exaction. At this stage itself, it must be made clear that the\n","\n","concept of royalty is being considered from the perspective ofSection 9of the MMDR Act, 1957 and not from any other\n","\n","context. Page 13 of 193tax” while the learned senior counsel and counsel for the\n","\n","respondents including the Attorney General and Solicitor\n","\n","General for the Union of India have submitted that “royalty is a\n","\n","tax or an exaction” and therefore, the States are denuded of\n","\n","their power to levy any other levy, impost, tax or cess on\n","\n","royalty. For the purpose of this case,Article 366(28)is relevant\n","\n","and the same reads as under:Article 246of the Constitution deals with the distribution of\n","\n","legislative powers between the Union and the States. The taxing\n","\n","powers of the Union as well as the States are also demarcated\n","\n","as separate Entries in the Union List as well as the State List\n","\n","i.e. The Entries in the Lists are\n","\n","fields of legislative powers conferred underArticle 246of the\n","\n","Constitution. It is in the above backdrop that the controversy\n","\n","must be considered.8.7    Exercise of mineral rights have to be consistent with\n","\n","mineral development in the country, which would embrace,\n","\n","inter alia, uniformity in mineral development throughout the\n","\n","country having regard to several factors which would otherwise\n","\n","come in the way of such development. Page 30 of 193said Act to mean either a reconnaissance permit, prospecting\n","\n","licence, mining lease, composite licence or a combination of any\n","\n","of these and the expression “concession” shall be construed\n","\n","accordingly.Section 3(c)defines “mining lease” to mean a lease\n","\n","granted for the purpose of undertaking mining operations and\n","\n","includes a sub-lease granted for such purpose.Section 3(d)defines “mining operations” to mean any operation undertaken\n","\n","for the purpose of winning any mineral.Section 3(h)defines\n","\n","“prospecting operations” to mean any operations undertaken\n","\n","for the purpose of exploring, locating or proving mineral\n","\n","deposits.Section 3(ha)defines “reconnaissance operations” to\n","\n","mean any operation undertaken for preliminary prospecting of\n","\n","a mineral through regional, aerial, geophysical or geochemical\n","\n","surveys and geological mapping, but does not include pitting,\n","\n","trenching, drilling (except drilling of boreholes on a grid\n","\n","specified from time to time by the Central Government) or sub-\n","\n","surface excavation.10.3      It is observed that theMMDR Act, 1957specifies the\n","\n","twin purposes of the Act, namely, (1) the regulation of mines,Civil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Sections 4 to 10 of the Central Act form a group\n","\n","headed ‘General Restrictions on Undertaking Prospecting and\n","\n","Mining Operations’ and relate to the rules and regulations\n","\n","under which prospecting licences and mining leases might be\n","\n","granted; the period for which they may be granted or renewed;\n","\n","the royalties and fees that would be payable on them etc. The\n","\n","next group of Sections, namely,Sections 10to12deal with the\n","\n","procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining leases in\n","\n","respect of land in which minerals vest in the Government.Sections 13to17are grouped under a caption which reads -\n","\n","“Rules for regulating the grant of Prospecting Licences and\n","\n","Mining Leases”.Section 13empowers the Central Government,\n","\n","by notification, to make rules for regulating the grant of\n","\n","prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals\n","\n","and for purposes connected therewith. Sub-section (2) specifies\n","\n","in particular the matters for which such rules may provide and\n","\n","among them is (i) the fixing and collection of fees for mineral\n","\n","concession, surface rent, security deposit, fines, other fees orCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc.

The question considered was “whether\n","\n","the extent of control and regulation” provided by the Central\n","\n","Act took within its fold the area or the subject covered by the\n","\n","Orissa Act. The test was, therefore, if under power\n","\n","confirmed bySection 18(1)of the Central Government had\n","\n","made rules providing for the amenities for which provision was\n","\n","made by the Orissa Act and if the Central Government had\n","\n","imposed a fee to defray the expenses of the provision of these\n","\n","amenities, would such rules be held to be ultra vires the Central\n","\n","Act, particularly, when taken in conjunction with the matters\n","\n","for which rules could be made underSection 13to which\n","\n","reference has been made.13.1     M. Hidayatullah, C.J. This Court held that once theMMDR Act, 1957was enacted by the Parliament, the Union had\n","\n","taken all the powers to itself and had authorised the State\n","\n","Government to make Rules for the regulation of leases. By the\n","\n","declaration and the enactment ofSection 15of the MMDR Act,\n","\n","1957, the whole of the field relating to minor minerals came\n","\n","within the jurisdiction of Parliament and no scope was left for\n","\n","the enactment of the second proviso toSection 10(2)in theBihar Land Reforms Act. The petitions challenged the notices\n","\n","mainly on the ground that what were being used by them for\n","\n","manufacture of bricks, which were minor minerals and\n","\n","therefore, the Bihar State Government had no authority in law\n","\n","to impose any royalty in respect of minor minerals. In the said\n","\n","case, the High Court considered the definition of “taxation”\n","\n","underArticle 366(28)of the Constitution of India to include the\n","\n","imposition of any tax or impost and observed that the\n","\n","expression royalty is used in a secondary sense to signify that\n","\n","part of the reddendum which is variable and depends upon the\n","\n","quantity of minerals taken out. Royalty is an impost by the\n","\n","Government and was in the nature of tax because it was a\n","\n","compulsory exaction recoverable, in the event of non-payment,\n","\n","as if it was arrears of land revenue. Anything beyond what is\n","\n","declared by Parliament to be expedient in the public interest to\n","\n","be kept under the control of the Union, will be under the\n","\n","legislative ambit of the State in regard to mines and mineral\n","\n","development in the State.The MMDR Act, 1957is an enactment\n","\n","of the Parliament for the regulation of mines and the\n","\n","development of minerals under the control of the Union. Referring to various provisions of theMMDR Act, 1957such asSection 3(a)which defines “minerals” to include all minerals\n","\n","except mineral oils; “mining lease” inSection 3(c)and ”mining\n","\n","operations” inSection 3(d)and the definition of ‘minor minerals”\n","\n","inSection 3(e)of the said Act, it was observed thatSection 2of\n","\n","the said Act declared that it was expedient in public interest\n","\n","that the Union should take under its control the regulation ofCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. Further, on a reading ofSections 4to13of the said Act, it was\n","\n","clear that the Parliament gave control of all mines and minerals\n","\n","except mineral oil, to the Union Government. Therefore, Entry 54 - List I gave the power to\n","\n","the Union Government to regulate all mines and development in\n","\n","minerals except oils thereby leaving no area for legislation in\n","\n","that respect to the State Legislature. That the Parliament had\n","\n","given power to the Union Government to modify the rates of\n","\n","royalty for all minerals except for minor minerals in respect of\n","\n","which the matter was left to the States. Insofar as minor\n","\n","minerals are concerned, imposition of royalty was within the\n","\n","power of the State Government by way of rules. Also, rules\n","\n","made by the State Government prior to the enforcement of theMMDR Act, 1957continued to be operative till fresh rules were\n","\n","enforced, being the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules,\n","\n","1984. Page 87 of 193should be given to the said expression considering the question\n","\n","in the context of the Bihar Minor Minerals Concession Rules,\n","\n","1954     and      the     impugned        notices   demanding    royalty. But once the Parliament\n","\n","makes a declaration by law that it is expedient in the public\n","\n","interest to make regulation of mines and development of\n","\n","minerals under the control of the Union, to the extent to whichCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. We are, therefore, of the opinion that by the enactment\n","    of the Central Act, the State Legislature lost its legislative\n","    power under Entries 23 and 50 of List II to the extent\n","    indicated in the Central Act. Page 95 of 193Mahanadi Coalfields:Goodricke:22.3        However, in Goodricke, it was observed that tax\n","\n","imposed on land measured with reference to or on the basis of\n","\n","its yield, is certainly a tax directly on the land. Page 105 of 19322.5      Having noted this sui generis relationship above, I may\n","\n","observe     the    difficulty     in      drawing   any   further    analogy\n","\n","between Goodricke and               the      instant   case. On the\n","\n","other hand, what is common to both Kannadasan and Tata\n","\n","Iron and Steel is the fact that they proceeded on the basis that\n","\n","this Court, having set aside the incompetent levies imposed by\n","\n","the States and the Parliament, coming forward to support the\n","\n","States vis-à-vis their apprehension regarding refund to be made\n","\n","on the basis of the principle of unjust enrichment, enacted the\n","\n","Validation Act. It was further observed that in view of the Parliamentary\n","\n","legislation under Entry 54 - List I, namely, theMMDR Act,\n","\n","1957, and the declaration made underSection 2and the\n","\n","provisions ofSection 9thereof, the State’s power would be\n","\n","overridden to that extent.32. The reasons for saying\n","\n","so are as follows:Provided that the Central Government shall not\n","\n","          enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any\n","\n","          mineral more than once during any period of three\n","\n","          years. This power is reserved only with the Central\n","\n","          Government, which is in the interest of mineral\n","\n","          development in a uniform manner throughout the\n","\n","          country.- List II by a State Government. There would then be legal uncertainty which would\n","\n","cause adverse economic consequences including on mineral\n","\n","development in India. Federalism in India:36.3The Government of India Act, 1935was the first\n","\n","comprehensive blueprint for legislative division of power in\n","\n","India between federal, provincial and concurrent spheres which\n","\n","resolved residuary powers to rest with the Federal Government. The\n","\n","question of a desirable balance between Central and the State\n","\n","Governments has to be viewed in the context of the country\n","\n","continuing to confront the need to promote economic growth\n","\n","while upholding and expanding social rights. Mutual trust and confidence can be built up only if, on\n","    the one hand, the Union Government promptly revises\n","    royalty rates at reasonable intervals and on the other, the\n","    States abstain from arbitrary action in levy of cesses, etc. 37.2     One has to also appreciate the pragmatic solution-\n","\n","oriented approach coupled with the acknowledgment that the\n","\n","subject matter of this lis-taxation on minerals-which are\n","\n","natural resources, should be exploited for the development of\n","\n","the country as a whole. It is with the above background that the\n","\n","distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the\n","\n","States were thought of in a manner that would give an upper\n","\n","hand to Parliamentary supremacy, so to say, over the legislative\n","\n","power of the State. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I find that the\n","\n","learned Attorney General is right in contending that theMMDR\n","\n","Act, 1957contemplates all manner of levies, charges, impost or\n","\n","demands that could be provided for having a nexus with\n","\n","mineral rights.\n","384\n","[-0.03006744, 0.06812214, -0.06554021, -0.07182721, -0.10378708, 0.008924067, 0.06487436,

statutory\n","\n","framework of theMMDR Act, 1957passed by the Parliament on\n","\n","the strength of Entry 54 – List I of the Seventh Schedule of the\n","\n","Constitution of India and having regard toSection 2of the said\n","\n","Act, royalty is in the nature of a “tax” or an “exaction”. Page 7 of 193meaning of Entry 50 – List II of the Seventh Schedule of the\n","\n","Constitution and the States have no legislative competence to\n","\n","levy any other tax, impost or fee on the exercise of mineral\n","\n","rights. In particular, whetherSection 9of the\n","    aforementioned Act denudes or limits the scope of List II\n","    Entry 50?4. Whether “taxes on lands and buildings” in List II Entry\n","    49 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution contemplate\n","    a tax levied directly on the land as a unit having definite\n","    relationship with the land?7. What is the scope of the expression “taxes on mineral\n","    rights” in List II Entry 50 of the Seventh Schedule to the\n","    Constitution?8. Whether the expression “subject to any limitations\n","    imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral\n","    development” in List II Entry 50 refers to the subject-matter\n","    in List I Entry 54 of the Seventh Schedule to the\n","    Constitution?10. Whether in view of the declaration underSection 2of\n","     the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n","     1957 made in terms of List I Entry 54 of the Seventh\n","     Schedule to the Constitution and the provisions of the said\n","     Act, the State Legislature is denuded of its power under List\n","     II Entry 23 and/or List II Entry 50?11. Since the Entries under discussion are in their respective\n","\n","Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, it would be\n","\n","unnecessary to refer to them as being part of “the Seventh\n","\n","Schedule of the Constitution” in the following discussion.6. Would the\n","             constitutional position be any different qua mining\n","             land on account of Entry 50 of List II read with\n","             Entry 54 of List I?e. Whether Entry 50 of List II is a specific entry in\n","             relation to Entry 49 of List II, and would\n","             consequently subtract mining land from the scope of\n","             Entry 49 of List II?”7. Entry 54 - List\n","\n","I).8.6    However, what is pertinent to be considered in this case\n","\n","is, Entry 50 - List II in juxtaposition with Entry 54 - List I. speaking for the Bench traced the\n","\n","history of the legislation on the subject of mines and minerals\n","\n","by referring to Entry 36 of the Federal Legislative - List I and\n","\n","Entry 23 of the Provincial Legislative -List II of the Seventh\n","\n","Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935and also madeCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. The payment of royalty on exercise of mineral\n","\n","right is itself a tax and the royalty being considered as a\n","\n","measure for the purpose of payment of tax on land within the\n","\n","scope and ambit of Entry 49 – List II would not arise in view of\n","\n","there being a separate Entry 50 – List II.22.4     Moreover, in Goodricke, what was considered was\n","\n","Entry 52 – List I and not Entry 54 – List I. Entry 50 – List I\n","\n","which is subjected to Entry 54 – List I and the same being a\n","\n","unique Entry, would not apply while considering Entry 49 – List\n","\n","II in the context of Entry 52 – List I.

Entry 54 - List I. In view of what has been discussed above, in my view,\n","\n","Entry 49 - List II is an Entry of the widest amplitude. Therefore, Entry\n","\n","50 - List II would have to be viewed distinctly from Entry 49 -\n","\n","List II. Hence to get over the rigour of Entry\n","\n","50 – List II, the States cannot resort to Entry 49 – List II.

Entry 49 – List II is also not applicable to mineral\n","\n","bearing lands. The said\n","\n","Article has to be read along with the three Lists, namely, the\n","\n","Union List, the State List and the Concurrent List. List I and List II respectively. (vide:State of Karnataka vs. State of Meghalaya, (2023) 4\n","\n","SCC 416 para 56), (“State of Karnataka”).8.3    In order to understand the foundation of this controversy,\n","\n","it is necessary to considerArticle 246of the Constitution and\n","\n","the relevant Entries of the two Lists vis-à-vis regulation of\n","\n","mines and mineral development, as the controversy has arisen\n","\n","in this particular context, which can be usefully extracted as\n","\n","under:Thus, the Entries on levy of taxes are specifically\n","\n","mentioned. Such a power has to be\n","\n","determined by the nature of the tax and not the measure or\n","\n","machinery set up by the statute.8.5     Entry 54 - List I read with Entry 23 - List II deals with\n","\n","regulation of mines and mineral development. Since both the\n","\n","Entries deal with regulation of mines and mineral development\n","\n","and they are in List I and List II, Entry 23 - List II expressly\n","\n","states that any regulation of mines and mineral development is\n","\n","subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation andCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc. 8.8    The golden thread which runs through Entry 54 - List I\n","\n","and Entry 23 - List II is that the Entries deal with regulation of\n","\n","mines and mineral development. Page 61 of 193include the provision of amenities to workmen employed in the\n","\n","mines which was necessary in order to stimulate or maintain\n","\n","the working of mines. Page 64 of 193reference to Entry 54 - List I - Union List, Entry 23 – List II -\n","\n","State List.That the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and\n","\n","Development) Act, 1948, (“MMRD Act, 1948”) had a declaration\n","\n","underSection 2to the same effect as the declaration underSection 2of the MMDR Act, 1957.

However, inSections 14and15, an exception was carved with regard to\n","\n","minor minerals. It was reasoned that, Entry 54 - List I uses the expression\n","\n","“mines and minerals” which includes (i) regulation of mines and(ii) mineral development. The contention of the assessee was only with\n","\n","regard to levies to be collected up to 04.04.1991 under the\n","\n","Validation Act and not after that date. Page 150 of 193Entries 49 and 50 – List II:29. The second aspect of this case which also requires\n","\n","consideration is with regard to interplay of Entries 49 and 50 -\n","\n","List II in the context of mineral bearing lands.- List II deals with regulation of mines and mineral development\n","\n","subject to the provisions of List I, i.e. Page 157 of 193Entries 49 and 50 - List II, are distinct.

However, the controversy in this case would demonstrate\n","\n","how a State with substantial mineral reserves manages,\n","\n","regulates and taxes its resources without hurting the national\n","\n","interest and the development of the country in the context of\n","\n","mineral development. Therefore, the respective Entries in Lists I\n","\n","and II, namely, the Union List and the State List respectively,\n","\n","have been so drafted in order to ensure that there is overall\n","\n","mineral development in the country as a whole, rather than\n","\n","particular States possessing the mineral wealth acting contraryCivil Appeal Nos.4056-4064 of 1999 Etc.

Such\n","\n","    sub-classification would be violative ofArticle 14of the\n","\n","    Constitution. The learned counsel for the respondents heavily relies upon\n","           the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in E.V.

In order to appreciate the rival contentions raised in the instant\n","\n","    Reference, it would be beneficial to reproduce the relevant provisions\n","\n","    of the Constitution for ready reference.“Article 14. The\n","\n","   doctrines of Precedents and Stare decisis are the core values of our\n","\n","   legal system. In series of cases, the Constitution Benches of this Court\n","\n","   have time and again emphasized that when a decision is rendered by\n","\n","   this Court, it acquires a reliance interest and the society organizes itself\n","\n","   based on such legal order. When substantial judicial time and resources\n","\n","   are spent on the References by the Constitution Benches, the same\n","\n","   should not be further referred to the larger Bench by a smaller Bench,\n","\n","   in a casual or cavalier manner, and without recording the reasons for\n","\n","   disagreement.24(a)    Law on Constitution Interpretation. Sometimes as a matter of constitutional necessity, it may\n","\n","    be prudent to widen the search for the true meaning, purport, and ambit\n","\n","    of the provision under consideration, however, one has to bear in mind\n","\n","    that no provision, no word or expression in the Constitution exists in\n","\n","    isolation. They are necessarily related to, transforming and in turn being\n","\n","    transformed by, other provisions, words and phrases in the Constitution. Even if a dynamic interpretation is necessary and the meaning\n","\n","    necessary to fit the changed circumstances is found in the text itself, it\n","\n","    would be always better to tread a path as close as possible to the text,\n","\n","    by gathering the plain ordinary meaning, to see whether that meaning\n","\n","    is validated by the constitutional values and the scheme. While giving a\n","\n","    broad and generous construction to the constitutional provisions, the\n","\n","    rule of “plain meaning,” or “literal” interpretation, which remains “the\n","\n","    primary rule” has to be kept in mind.33(b)    The Object, Purpose and Limits ofArticle 341: -33. The relevant part of the\n","\n","    proceedings of the Constituent Assembly debate on September 17,\n","\n","    1949 is reproduced hereunder: -The only change is, the word ‘specified’ has been changed to\n","           ‘deemed’. As far as I can see he has made it clear that\n","according to the second part of it, the President on the 26th\n","January 1950 will publish a list of such communities that come\n","under the category of Scheduled Castes. Such convert\n","cannot come under the scope of this definition. I do not think that the reasons that he has advanced are fair and\n","square for the uplift of the Harijans.With these few words, I support the amendment. The\n","\n","    relevant clauses of the said two Presidential Orders were in the following\n","\n","    terms:43. Any such action on the part of the State would not only\n","\n","    tantamount to discrimination in reverse and violation ofArticle 14but\n","\n","    would also tantamount to tinkering withArticle 341of the Constitution.55. As per the settled legal position, every word or expression used in the\n","\n","    Constitution has a purpose, and all the provisions of the Constitution\n","\n","    have to be read in harmony so that the meaning of such word or\n","\n","    expression is validated by the Constitutional values and the scheme. As well-settled, the whole doctrine of “colourable\n","\n","       exercise” is based on the maxim - “you cannot do indirectly what you\n","\n","       cannot do directly.”* Any action of the State in the name of affirmative\n","\n","       action, if not permitted by the Constitution, could not be validated or\n","\n","       vindicated by the Courts by moulding or tinkering with the specific\n","\n","       provisions of the Constitution. The plenary powers of this Court underArticle 142of the\n","              Constitution      are      inherent     in   the    Court    and\n","              are complementary to those powers which are specifically\n","              conferred on the Court by various statutes though are not\n","              limited by those statutes. These powers also exist\n","              independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice\n","              between the parties. These powers are of very wide amplitude\n","              and are in the nature of supplementary powers. This power\n","              exists as a separate and independent basis of jurisdiction\n","              apart from the statutes. It, however, needs to\n","              be remembered that the powers conferred on the Court byArticle 142being curative in nature cannot be construed as\n","              powers which authorise the Court to ignore the substantive\n","              rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it. Punishing a contemner advocate, while\n","              dealing with a contempt of court case by suspending his\n","              licence to practice, a power otherwise statutorily\n","              available only to the Bar Council of India, on the ground that\n","              the contemner is also an advocate, is, therefore, not\n","              permissible in exercise of the jurisdiction underArticle 142.The construction ofArticle 142must be functionally informed\n","              by the salutary purposes of the article, viz., to do complete\n","              justice between the parties. It cannot be otherwise. As already\n","              noticed in a case of contempt of court, the contemner and the\n","              court cannot be said to be litigating parties.”78. The action of the State though well-intentioned and affirmative in nature,\n","\n","    if violates the specific provision of the Constitution, cannot be validated\n","\n","    by the Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction underArticle 142.The removal of inequalities or remedy to remove inequalities cannot be\n","\n","    permitted at the cost of violation of the specific provision of the\n","\n","    Constitution. When the wordings of the provision of the statutes, in the\n","\n","    instant case ofArticle 341of the Constitution are clear, as also the81intention of the draftsmen of the Constitution, the Court cannot add or\n","\n","    subtract words from such provision to give it a meaning which the Court\n","\n","    feels would achieve the goal of social transformation. Sometimes the\n","\n","    affirmative action and the Constitution intersect with each other in\n","\n","    complex ways, as the affirmative action policies are framed by the\n","\n","    States to promote diversity and to address historical inequalities, while\n","\n","    the legal frameworks have to ensure that these policies are\n","\n","    implemented within the bounds of the Constitution. In short, the affirmative action and the legal frameworks,\n","\n","    though both do aim at more equitable society, they must navigate\n","\n","    complex legal principles to ensure fairness and Constitutionality. (vii) Under the guise of providing reservation or under the pretext of\n","\n","    taking affirmative action for the weaker of the weakest sections of\n","\n","    the society, the State cannot vary the Presidential List, nor can\n","\n","    tinker withArticle 341of the Constitution.84(ix) The power conferred upon the Supreme Court underArticle 142cannot be used to supplant the substantive law applicable to the\n","\n","    case under consideration. The action of the State, though well\n","\n","    intentioned and affirmative in nature, if violates the specific\n","\n","    provision of the Constitution, cannot be validated by the Supreme\n","\n","    Court in exercise of its jurisdiction underArticle 142.85(x) The affirmative action and legal frameworks, though both do aim at\n","\n","         more equitable society, they must navigate complex legal\n","\n","         principles to ensure fairness and constitutionality.80. the Legislature, the\n","\n","     Executive and the Judiciary to bring about social justice by\n","\n","     promoting the reservation policy and its implementation in such\n","\n","     a manner that not only the backwards but the most backwards33of the backwards are brought into the forefront with the\n","\n","     mainstream. The Skanda Purana also contains a shloka:64. Gita\n","\n","     nowhere preaches that the aforesaid varnas are on the basis of\n","\n","     birth and are not interchangeable. He\n","\n","     described the untouchables as ‘persons of God’ - ‘Harijans’. The\n","\n","    country as such had moved into a casteless society except for\n","\n","    the above legal fiction only for the purposes of the constitution\n","\n","    and not otherwise.70. So are the benefits\n","\n","     extended to the reserved category of persons under the\n","\n","     constitution. At the cost of being45called ‘Anti Dalit’, I quote Nani A Palkiwala from his book ‘We,\n","\n","      The Nation, The Lost Decades)21\n","\n","                    “The basic structure of the Constitution envisages\n","                    a cohesive, unified, casteless society. By breathing\n","                    new life into casteism, the judgment fractures the\n","                    nation and disregards the basic structure of the\n","                    Constitution. The\n","                    majority judgments will revive casteism which the\n","                    Constitution emphatically intended to end; and the\n","                    pre-independence tragedy would be re-enacted\n","                    with the roles reversed – the erstwhile\n","                    underprivileged would not become the privileged.”76.\n","384\n","[-0.083536595,

Punjab\n","\n","           Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services\n","\n","           Act, 2006) are constitutionally valid?46.

The importance of the doctrine of binding Precedents in the\n","\n","   administration of our judicial system hardly needs to be reiterated. Similar provision is made for Scheduled Tribes in Article342.Article 342 (A)pertaining to the socially and educationally\n","\n","      backward classes is slightly differently worded, which was inserted by\n","\n","      the Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act, 2018 w.e.f 14.08.2018.3435. 201 of List V (Eighth Week) in clause\n","(2) of the proposed new article 300B after the words ‘Parliament\n","may’ the words ‘and subject to its decision the State Legislature’\n","be inserted.”\n","\n","I have always been fighting that the Governor should have power\n","to safeguard the rights of the Tribes.

They were known as “depressed classes.” The\n","\n","term “depressed classes” however was not synonymous with “backward\n","\n","classes.” From the study material placed before us, it appears that the\n","\n","Census Commissioner J.H. The word “class” in “depressed class” was in fact\n","\n","    referred to for “caste.” Eventually, the Government of India Act 1935\n","\n","    referred to the “depressed classes” as “Scheduled Castes”. Similar\n","\n","    definitions are contained inArticle 366(25)for the “Scheduled Tribes”\n","\n","    and inArticle 366(26C)for the “socially and educationally backward\n","\n","    classes”.49.Article 15(4)enables the State to make special provision for the\n","\n","    advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of\n","\n","    citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Further,Article 340empowers the\n","\n","    President to appoint a Commission to investigate the conditions of\n","\n","    Socially and Educationally Backward Classes within the territory of India\n","\n","    and to make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by\n","\n","    the Union or any State to remove the difficulties of the members of such\n","\n","    class. Similar provision is found inArticle 342for\n","\n","    the Scheduled Tribes.Article 342Ainserted by theConstitution (One\n","\n","    Hundred and Second Amendment Act, 2018) with effect from 14th\n","\n","    August, 2018, empowers the President to specify the Socially and\n","\n","    Educationally Backward Classes in the Central List which are deemed\n","\n","    to be Socially and Educationally Backward Classes in relation to that\n","\n","    State or Union Territory as the case may be. The Question-3(a) was, “what does the\n","\n","    expression “backward class of citizens” inArticle 16(4)mean?” The\n","\n","    Question-3(e) was, “whether the class, to be designated as a backward\n","\n","    class, should be situated similarly to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\n","\n","    Tribes?” The Question-10 was, “whether the distinction made in the\n","\n","    second memorandum between poorer sections of the backward classes\n","\n","    and others was permissible underArticle 16?”68“47. The\n","\n","     remaining depressed classes of persons or marginalized classes\n","\n","     were later classified as other backward classes.14.The Government of India Act, 1935, for the first time, recognized\n","\n","     the above referred depressed classes of persons as scheduled9castes and the primitive tribes as backward tribes and inter alia\n","\n","     provided reservation of seats for the scheduled castes and\n","\n","     backward tribes in the federal legislature.

Lokur Committee, reported and concluded that the question of\n","\n","    de-scheduling (or excluding) of relatively advanced communities\n","\n","    should    receive    serious    and    urgent    consideration. However, a significant\n","\n","     segment of the population that was otherwise socially,\n","\n","     economically and politically backward were not given any\n","\n","     privileges or benefits of upliftment. In order\n","\n","     to address this anomaly, the most talked about second\n","\n","     backward class Commission was constituted on 1st January,\n","\n","     1979 by the Government of India which is popularly known as\n","\n","     B. P. Mandal Commission. This Commission was entrusted with\n","\n","     the     job    to   investigate   the   conditions   of    socially   and\n","\n","     educationally backward classes, to recommend the criteria for25defining such classes of citizens, steps to be taken for their\n","\n","    advancement and upliftment and the manner in which they can\n","\n","    be extending the benefit of the reservation.46. The Commission submitted its report on 31st December, 1980. The Commission on the basis of 1961 census compiled a\n","\n","    national list of 3743 classes of persons under the heading\n","\n","    ‘Other Backward Classes’ out of which 2108 were classified as\n","\n","    ‘depressed backward classes’. 2018    Justice Raghvendra According to the Report there\n","                    Kumar Committee,   are 79 castes under the OBC\n","                                       category in the State out of\n","                    Uttar Pradesh\n","                                       which 9 are backward, 37 are\n","                                       more backward and 33 are\n","                                       most       backward      classes.51. It is also noticeable that enough\n","\n","     time and energy has been spent by all the three wings of the34State in streamlining the process of reservation and to evolve a\n","\n","     flawless mechanism for implementing the reservation policy but\n","\n","     still the non-visionary approach to handle the upliftment of the\n","\n","     backward castes has created more difficulties rather than\n","\n","     ironing them out.53. Specially, during the\n","\n","     anti-Mandal Commission agitation somewhere in 1990, most of\n","\n","     the States witnessed large scale disturbances. It may not be out of context to point out that apart from the\n","\n","     anti-Mandal Commission violence, the country witnessed\n","\n","     similar violence in the year 2006 when the students of IITs and\n","\n","     AIIMS came out on the streets opposing reservation. Thus, depriving\n","\n","    such children or the drop outs, at the primary level of the benefit\n","\n","    of reservation or upliftment in any other manner, as a result of\n","\n","    which these children ultimately remain the most backward of\n","\n","    the backwards.56. The statistics proves that the deprived and the marginalized\n","\n","    persons have not been able to achieve the benefit of reservation36which is permissible at higher level as about 50% of the\n","\n","    students from the most backward classes drop out of school\n","\n","    before Class-V and 75% drop out before Class-VIII. But the issue is how to carry out the process to bring about\n","\n","    equality and development of all, the manner of identification of\n","\n","    the so-called depressed classes or the downtrodden and the\n","\n","    form/nature of steps to be taken for their upliftment. The\n","\n","    Government has used caste as the basis for the upliftment\n","\n","    rather than identifying the class of people on the basis of\n","\n","    vocation or their social and economic conditions who actually\n","\n","    requires help to be promoted to the level of the forward class. The experience shows that the better of the class\n","\n","    amongst the backwards eats up most of the vacancies/seats\n","\n","    reserved leaving the most backward with nothing in their\n","\n","    hands.58. The student ‘C’ who is also of the backward\n","\n","    class but has no advantage as that which is available to both ‘A’\n","\n","    and ‘B’, despite competing in the backward category remains\n","\n","    unsuccessful. He continues to remain unsuccessful in the\n","\n","    following years as well, as again and again backward category\n","\n","    candidates having the status equivalent to that of a forward\n","\n","    class or that which is available to ‘A’ and ‘B’ keeps on qualifying\n","\n","    leaving the most backward of the backwards far behind. In this38manner, the most backward of the backward category loses the\n","\n","     battle even with the backward classes who are practically\n","\n","     enjoying the status of the forward class people. Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, during the entire\n","\n","     freedom struggle strenuously worked for the upliftment of the\n","\n","     so-called depressed classes including ‘untouchables’. Slowly the varna system prevalent was\n","\n","    misconstrued to be a caste system which practice was found to\n","\n","    be socially non-acceptable and as such after independence with\n","\n","    the adoption of the Constitution we again tried to move into a44casteless society but in the name of social welfare to uplift the\n","\n","     depressed and the backward classes, we again fell into the trap\n","\n","     of caste system. We gave privilege of reservation to the\n","\n","     depressed or the backward class or the Scheduled Caste to\n","\n","     bring about equality.71. Anyone who suggests another or\n","\n","     a better way of helping the so-called depressed classes or the\n","\n","     downtrodden or the marginalised persons of the society is\n","\n","     immediately pounced upon as ‘Anti Dalit’. He wrote:Despite the views so expressed, the Constitutional amendments\n","\n","     envisaged to promote the depressed and the backward classes\n","\n","     of persons to bring them to the level of the privileged class\n","\n","     enjoying the status of an urban elite. Thus, the reservation\n","\n","     policy was rightly applied and since its implementation faced\n","\n","     difficulties as some in the backward classes have marched\n","\n","     ahead, it has become imperative to uplift the backward of the\n","\n","     backwards, for which purpose sub-classification has become\n","\n","     the order of the day.78.\n","384\n","[-0.05265896, 0.114383064,

process of rationalising the reservation to the Scheduled Castes,8the constitutional mandate ofArticles 14, 15and16could be\n","\n","         violated.

Sir, I move: “That with reference to amendment No. In order to\n","fill up that lacuna I have said that Parliament may and subject to\n","its decision the State Legislature.Shri. In these you have covered a good deal which you\n","had objected to in the past. Going\n","backwards to 1916 it was in that year when Government found\n","that something had to be done for the untouchable classes,\n","(when they said untouchable classes, they were always\n","understood to be Hindus,) and they had to be recognised. Mr. President: Does anyone else wish to speak? The first is the one\n","with reference to amendment 147.The question is: “That with reference to amendment No. These48were the communities which suffered social disabilities such as being\n","\n","    denied access to temples, use separate wells, and not being allowed to\n","\n","    sit inside a school house etc. The subsequent amendments to the aforesaid two Orders, from time to\n","\n","    time were made to bring the position in tune with the amendments to the\n","\n","    First Schedule to the Constitution made at different points of time by50creation of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of\n","\n","    existing States.44. To\n","           confuse this backwardmost social composition with castes is to\n","           commit a constitutional error, misled by a compendious\n","           appellation. So that, to protect harijans is not to prejudice\n","           any caste but to promote citizen solidarity.Article 16(2)is out of\n","           the way and to extend protective discrimination to this mixed bag\n","           of tribes, races, groups, communities and non-castes outside the\n","           four-fold Hindu division is not to compromise with the\n","           acceleration of castelessness enshrined in the sub-article. This\n","              plenary jurisdiction is, thus, the residual source of power which\n","              this Court may draw upon as necessary whenever it is just and\n","              equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance\n","              of the due process of law, to do complete justice between the\n","\n","\n","\n","25 (1998) 4 SCC 40980parties, while administering justice according to law.

Man/human as rightly understood is a social animal and has\n","\n","     to live in a society. Slowly, these depressed classes of persons came to\n","\n","     be classified into various groups according to their vocation\n","\n","     such as scavengers, leather workers, ironsmiths, carpenters,\n","\n","     watchman and other menial workers and were referred to as\n","\n","     scheduled castes; and those living in tribes in hills, forests or\n","\n","     remote areas came to be recognized as scheduled tribes. The Central Government, few years back, in\n","\n","    order to provide free education to children enacted Right to\n","\n","    Education Act, 2009. The aforesaid Act proved to be a very weak\n","\n","    legislation and have not been able to provide primary education\n","\n","    to one and all irrespective of the caste, creed, race, religion and\n","\n","    sex as most of the children of the so-called depressed class\n","\n","    either fail to attend schools or drop out after one and two years\n","\n","    of education. The figure\n","\n","    goes to even 95 per cent when it comes to the level of high\n","\n","    school. By referring to the above agitations, disturbances, violence,\n","\n","    litigation and shortcomings, I do not to intend to suggest that\n","\n","    the task of upliftment of the downtrodden be brought to an end\n","\n","    or that the government should give up the reservation policy.

It stands upon the foundation and the\n","              basis for its exercise may be put on a different and perhaps\n","              even wider footing, to prevent injustice in the process of\n","              litigation and to do complete justice between the parties.

is\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","CIVIL APPEAL NO.2317 OF 2011ETC.ETC.also applicable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n","Tribes, and that the criteria for exclusion of creamy\n","layer for the purpose of

(Paragraph 31)(iv) The conglomeration of castes given in the Presidential Order,\n","\n","    should be considered as representing a class as a whole. The very idea of\n","\n","    placing different castes or tribes or group or part thereof in a State\n","\n","    as a conglomeration by way of a deeming definition clearly\n","\n","    suggests that they are not to be sub-divided or sub-classified\n","\n","    further. If a class within a class of members of the Scheduled Caste\n","\n","    is created, the same would amount to tinkering with the list. In case benefit which is meant for the\n","emancipation of all the castes, included in the List of Scheduled\n","Castes, is permitted to be usurped by few castes those who are\n","adequately represented, have advanced and belonged to the\n","creamy layer, then it would tantamount to creating inequality\n","whereas in case of hunger every person is required to be fed and\n","provided bread. The Scheduled Castes as per Presidential List are not frozen\n","for all the time, and neither they are a homogeneous group as\n","evident from the vast anthropological and statistical data\n","collected by various Commissions. The State law intends to provide reservation for\n","all Scheduled Castes in a pragmatic manner based on statistical\n","data. It distributes the benefits of reservations based on the\n","needs of each Scheduled Caste.In other words, for consideration as to whether the lawlaid down byE.V. —In this Constitution, unless the\n","context otherwise requires, the following expressions have the\n","meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say—\n","\n","(24) “Scheduled Castes” means such castes, races or tribes or\n","parts of or groups within such castes, races or tribes as are\n","deemed underarticle 341to be Scheduled Castes for the\n","purposes of this Constitution;(25) “Scheduled Tribes” means such tribes or tribal communities\n","or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as21are deemed underarticle 342to be Scheduled Tribes for the\n","            purposes of this Constitution;(26) .…..****\n","            (26A) ……..(26B) ……..19.

Since the whole matter hinges on the interpretation ofArticle 341of the\n","\n","      Constitution of India, let us see the Object and Purpose of its insertion\n","\n","      in the Constitution.34.Article 341states that the President may with respect to any State or\n","\n","      Union territory, and where it is a State after consultation with the\n","\n","      Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the castes, races and\n","\n","      tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes which shall for\n","\n","      the purposes of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in\n","\n","      relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be. 148 of List IV (Eighth Week), for sub-clause (x) of clause (1) ofarticle 303, the following sub-clause be substituted: —(x) scheduled tribes’ means such tribes or tribal communities or\n","           parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are\n","           deemed under article 300B of this Constitution to be scheduled\n","           tribes for the purposes of this Constitution;'\n","           I am incorporating the other amendment which has also been\n","           tabled. — (1) The President may after\n","consultation with the Governor or Ruler of a State, by public\n","notification specify the tribes or tribal communities or parts of or\n","groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall for\n","purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be scheduled tribes\n","in relation to that State. It is now proposed that\n","the President, in consultation with the Governor or Ruler of a\n","State should have the power to issue a general notification in the\n","Gazette specifying all the Castes and tribes or groups thereof\n","deemed to be Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the\n","purposes of the privileges which have been defined for them in\n","the Constitution. But I would like to\n","inform this House of the background which brought out the\n","special name of Scheduled Castes. While I have no\n","objection to Government granting any concessions to these\n","converts, I feel strongly that they should not be clubbed along\n","with Scheduled Castes.39Sir, I am grateful to the Drafting Committee and also to the\n","Chairman of that Committee for making the second portion of it\n","very clear, that in future, after the declaration by the President as\n","to who will be the Scheduled Castes, and when there is need for\n","including any other class or to exclude anybody or any\n","community from the list of Scheduled Castes that must be by the\n","word of Parliament. I feel grateful to him for bringing in this\n","clause, because I know, as a matter of fact, when Harijans\n","behave independently or asserting their right on some matters,\n","the Ministers in some Provinces not only take note and action\n","against those members, but they bring the community to which\n","that particular individual belongs; and thereby not only the\n","individual, but also the community that comes under that\n","category of Scheduled Castes are harassed. But he has\n","entirely forgotten that under another article that we have already\n","passed, or will pass the Constitution provides for the appointment\n","of a Special officer at the Centre and also various officers in all\n","the Provinces to go into the various disabilities of these\n","communities and to submit a report to the President who will then\n","be able to know whether the Scheduled Castes have reached a\n","stage when the facilities now given to them could be withdrawn. 147 of\n","List IV (Eighth Week), for sub-clause (w) of clause (1) ofarticle\n","303, the following sub-clause be substituted: —\n","‘(w) ‘Scheduled Castes’ means such castes, races or tribes or\n","parts of or groups within such castes, races or tribes as are\n","deemed underarticle 300Aof this Constitution to be Scheduled40Castes for the purposes of this Constitution; The amendment\n","            was adopted”.36. From the bare\n","\n","    reading of theArticle 341it is clearly discernible that power of the\n","\n","    President is limited to specify the castes or the tribes which shall, for the\n","\n","    purposes of the Constitution, be deemed to be Scheduled Castes or\n","\n","    Scheduled Tribes in relation to a State or a Union Territory as the case\n","\n","    may be. As transpiring from the Constituent Assembly\n","\n","    Debates quoted hereinabove, the object of insertingArticle 341was to\n","\n","    eliminate the necessity of burdening the Constitution with long list of\n","\n","    Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It was proposed that the\n","\n","    President, in consultation with the Governor or Ruler of a State should\n","\n","    have power to issue a general notification in the Gazette specifying all41the Castes and tribes or groups thereof deemed to be Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes and Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of the privileges which\n","\n","    have been defined for them in the Constitution. Basavalingappa vs. D. Munichinnappa&\n","\n","    others16 had held that the object of the provision contained inArticle\n","\n","    341was to avoid all disputes as to whether a particular caste is a\n","\n","    Scheduled Caste or not, and only those castes can be Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes which are notified in the Order made by the President underArticle 341after consultation with the Governor where it relates to such\n","\n","    caste in a State. From the afore stated legal position, there is no room for doubt that the\n","\n","    Presidential List as notified underArticle 341assumes finality on the\n","\n","    publication of the notification, and that the castes, races or tribes or\n","\n","    parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes specified in the\n","\n","    notification are, for the purposes of the Constitution, deemed to be the\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” in relation to that State or Union Territory as the\n","\n","    case may be. Since the arguments have been advanced before us, on the issue\n","\n","    whether the Scheduled Castes specified in the Presidential List under47Clause (1) ofArticle 341should be treated as a homogenous group or\n","\n","heterogenous group, let us peep into the etymology of the\n","\n","nomenclatures “Scheduled Castes” and “Scheduled Tribes”. Hutton who conducted Census in 1931 had\n","\n","explained that the “depressed castes” were those castes, ‘the contact\n","\n","with whom entailed purification on the part of high caste Hindus’. The identification of the different castes for inclusion as Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes in the said Schedule was based on an elaborate exercise\n","\n","    conducted for each of the provinces as could be seen from the Schedule\n","\n","    consisting of nine parts, to the 1935 Act. Thereafter, a gazette\n","\n","    notification was published on 06.06.1936 promulgating the Government\n","\n","    of India (Scheduled Castes) Order 1936 notifying the list of castes that49were to be considered as “the Scheduled Castes” across the territory of\n","\n","    India. As discussed earlier, the Presidential Orders made underArticle 341(1)orArticle 342(1)enumerating the lists of castes/races, tribes recognized\n","\n","    as “Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes” cannot be altered or varied by\n","\n","    any State or any authority including the Court. The very language employed inArticle 341that “the castes, races or\n","\n","    tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes, shall for the\n","\n","    purposes of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in\n","\n","    relation to that State or Union Territory, as the case may be”, mandates\n","\n","    that each caste, each race, each tribe or each part of or group within the\n","\n","    castes, races or tribes shall by the deeming fiction be the “Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes” for the purposes of the Constitution, irrespective of the\n","\n","    parameters by which such caste/ race or tribe is recognised as\n","\n","    “Scheduled Caste” in relation to that State. Though the members of\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” are drawn from different castes, races and tribes,\n","\n","    they attain special status by virtue of Presidential Notification underArticle 341.Thus, the etymological and evolutionary history and51background of the nomenclature “Scheduled Castes,” coupled with the\n","\n","    Presidential Orders published underArticle 341of the Constitution,\n","\n","    make the “Scheduled Castes”, a homogenous class. The necessary\n","\n","    corollary would be that all the members of all the castes, races and\n","\n","    tribes enumerated in the Presidential List are deemed to be “Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes” for the purposes of the Constitution and they all would be\n","\n","    entitled to all the benefits granted or reserved for the “Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes”.“135. We may clear the clog ofArticle 16(2)as it stems from a\n","           confusion about caste in the terminology of scheduled castes\n","           and scheduled tribes. This latter expression has been defined inArticles 341and342.A bare reading brings out the quintessential\n","           concept that they (sic there) are no castes in the Hindu fold but\n","           an amalgam of castes, races, groups, tribes, communities or\n","           parts thereof found on investigation to be the lowliest and in need\n","           of massive State aid and notified as such by the President. The\n","           discerning sense of the Indian Corpus Juris has generally\n","           regarded scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, not as caste\n","           but as a large backward group deserving of societal\n","           compassion.”47. The above observations made in N.M. Thomas leaves no room of doubt\n","\n","    that “Scheduled Castes” are not a caste within the ordinary meaning of\n","\n","    caste. It is by virtue of the notification of the President underArticle 34154that the “Scheduled Castes” come into being. Though, the members of\n","\n","    the Scheduled Castes are drawn from different castes, races or tribes,\n","\n","    they attain a new Special Status by virtue of the Presidential notification. A bare reading ofArticle 341brings out the quintessential concept that\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” is an amalgam of castes, races, groups, tribes,\n","\n","    communities or parts thereof, and is a homogenous group, and that\n","\n","    once notified by Presidential List, they acquire Special Status of\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” which cannot be varied except by the Parliament\n","\n","    by law. (d) State’s Competence to sub-classify or sub-divide or re-group the\n","\n","    Castes specified as “Scheduled Castes” in the Presidential List for\n","\n","    providing the reservation underArticle 15and16: -48. for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Anglo-Indian\n","\n","    Community, Backward Class, Socially and Educationally Backward\n","\n","    Class etc.Articles 330and332provide for the reservation of seats for\n","\n","    the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the House of the People55and in the Legislative Assemblies of the States.Article 335states that\n","\n","    the claims of the member of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\n","\n","    Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently, with the\n","\n","    maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of\n","\n","    appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the\n","\n","    Union and of a State.Article 338, 338(A)and338(B)provides for the\n","\n","    constitution of the National Commissions for the Scheduled Castes,\n","\n","    Scheduled Tribes and for Backward Classes respectively. As per the\n","\n","    definition of “Scheduled Castes” contained inArticle 366(24),\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” means such castes, races or tribes or parts of or\n","\n","    groups within such castes, races or tribes as are deemed underArticle\n","\n","    341to be Scheduled Castes for the purposes of the Constitution. As discussed in detail earlier,Article 341empowers the President\n","\n","    to issue notification specifying the Scheduled Castes in relation to the\n","\n","    States and Union Territory. Though the executive power of the State Government is co-extensive\n","\n","       with the legislative power of the State Legislature, none of the entries,\n","\n","       either in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule confers any legislative\n","\n","\n","21   (1990) 4 SCC 55760power upon the State to rationalize the reservations, by sub-classifying\n","\n","    or sub-dividing the castes enumerated in the Presidential List prepared\n","\n","    underArticle 341(1), as was sought to be done by the State of Andhra\n","\n","    Pradesh by passing Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalization\n","\n","    of Reservations), Act 2000, nor does it confer any power to provide or\n","\n","    reserve the quota for a particular caste or castes from amongst the\n","\n","    “Scheduled Castes” enumerated in the Presidential List prepared underArticle 341(1)of the Constitution, as was sought to be done by the State\n","\n","    of Punjab and Haryana by passing thePunjab Scheduled Castes and\n","\n","    Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006. In absence of\n","\n","    any executive or legislative powers, the States are not competent to\n","\n","    divide/ sub-divide/ sub-classify/ regroup the castes, races or tribes from\n","\n","    amongst the “Scheduled Castes” nor could they give any preferential\n","\n","    treatment by reserving a quota for a particular caste, race, tribe out of\n","\n","    the quota reserved for the entire “Scheduled Castes”.54. Though sub-classification or sub division of castes from amongst the\n","\n","    Scheduled Castes by the State for the purpose of reservation per se\n","\n","    may not amount to inclusion or exclusion of any caste from the\n","\n","    Presidential List of Scheduled Castes, it would certainly amount to\n","\n","    tinkering with or varying the notification notified under Clause (1), which61is clearly prohibited under Clause (2). When all castes, races or tribes\n","\n","    enumerated in the Presidential List are deemed to be the “Scheduled\n","\n","    Castes” for the purposes of the Constitution, any preference given to or\n","\n","    any quota reserved for a particular caste or race or tribe out of the quota\n","\n","    reserved for the entire class of the Scheduled Castes for the\n","\n","    government jobs by the State, would certainly deprive the other\n","\n","    members of the “Scheduled Castes” from having the benefit of\n","\n","    reservation to the extent the quota is reserved for such particular caste\n","\n","    or castes. A\n","\n","    person belonging to any of the castes, races or tribes enumerated in the\n","\n","    Presidential List acquiring special status as the member of the\n","\n","    “Scheduled Caste” in relation to a particular State, would be entitled to\n","\n","    all the rights including the fundamental rights enshrined under the\n","\n","    Constitution, and therefore would also be entitled to be treated equally62from amongst the other members of the “Scheduled Castes”\n","\n","enumerated in such Presidential List, in that particular State. If any\n","\n","State makes special provision of reservation by fixing quota for the\n","\n","entire “Scheduled Castes” for admission to educational institutions or\n","\n","for the appointments on the posts in the public services as permitted\n","\n","underArticle 15and16, such quota of reservation should be made\n","\n","available to all the members of the “Scheduled Castes” specified in the\n","\n","Presidential List, as all the members of the castes, races and tribes\n","\n","specified in such List are deemed to be “Scheduled Castes” for the\n","\n","purposes of the Constitution, and the State has no power to further sub-\n","\n","classify or sub-divide the “Scheduled Castes” for giving preferential\n","\n","treatment to a particular caste from the said list of “Scheduled Castes”. As stated earlier, the very object ofArticle 341is to give new special\n","\n","status to the “Scheduled Castes” for the purposes of the Constitution\n","\n","and to keep the political interference of the States outside the purview\n","\n","of the said provisions. These\n","\n","    provisions underArticle 15and16are merely enabling provisions, and\n","\n","    could not be treated as the source of power to legislate the law for sub-\n","\n","    dividing or reclassifying/ sub-classifying or regrouping the castes, races\n","\n","    or tribes enumerated as the “Scheduled Castes”, which have acquired\n","\n","    special status by virtue ofArticle 341of the Constitution.57. Though the members\n","\n","    of Scheduled Castes are drawn from different castes, races or\n","\n","    tribes, they attain special status of “Scheduled Castes” by virtue of\n","\n","    Presidential Notification. The etymological and evolutionary history\n","\n","    and the background of the nomenclature “Scheduled Castes”,\n","\n","    coupled with the Presidential orders published underArticle 341of\n","\n","    the Constitution, make the “Scheduled Castes”, a homogenous\n","\n","    class, which cannot be tinkered with by the States. (vi) The States have no legislative competence to enact the law for\n","\n","    providing reservation or giving preferential treatment to a particular\n","\n","    caste/castes by dividing/sub-dividing/sub-classifying or regrouping\n","\n","    the castes, races or tribes enumerated as the “Scheduled Castes”\n","\n","    in the notification underArticle 341. In 1965, the Central Government appointed a Committee to\n","\n","    advise on the revision of the existing list of scheduled castes\n","\n","    and scheduled tribes. It\n","\n","    recommended for the intensive periodical survey of the socio-\n","\n","    economic progress made by each of the scheduled castes and\n","\n","    scheduled tribes, probably to exclude certain communities that\n","\n","    have progressed and to include those that have been left behind. It further recommended that in framing of development24schemes for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, priority\n","\n","     ought to be given to the welfare of the most backward amongst\n","\n","     them. It also prepared a list of communities (castes/tribes) that\n","\n","     were relatively forward and recommended to de-schedule or\n","\n","     exclude 14 scheduled tribes and 28 scheduled castes from the\n","\n","     list.45. Thus, only the children of some of the castes, who are\n","\n","    already affluent or urbanized, are able to obtain higher\n","\n","    education and the benefits of reservation.57. It\n","\n","    is for this reason, today we are grappling with a situation of sub-37classification of the castes notified for the purpose of\n","\n","    reservation. The varnas were given the\n","\n","     nomenclature of castes in a very loose manner.66. The Constitution at the same time videArticle 341conferred\n","\n","    power upon the President to notify certain castes, races or tribes\n","\n","    or part of such caste, races and tribes to be deemed to be\n","\n","    Scheduled Castes. ‘Reservation’ is one of the modes of helping or uplifting the\n","\n","     status of the OBCs/SCs/STs. Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru in his letter dated 27th June 1961\n","\n","       addressed to all the Chief Ministers of all the States laments\n","\n","       upon the habit of giving reservations and privileges to any caste\n","\n","       or group and expresses that such practice ought to be given up\n","\n","\n","23 (1976) 2 SCC 310\n","24 (1971) 1 SCC 38\n","25 (1981) 1 SCC 24647and emphasis to help the citizens on economic considerations\n","\n","and not on caste basis and that the Scheduled Castes and\n","\n","Scheduled Tribes do deserve help but not in the shape of any\n","\n","kind of reservation more particularly in services. The Chief Justice in his opinion has dwelled upon the legal\n","\n","     aspects to answer the core issue whether sub-classification of\n","\n","     the scheduled castes is constitutionally permissible for the49purposes of reservation. There is no violation ofArticle 341(2)of the\n","\n","    Constitution in sub-classification within the scheduled caste as\n","\n","    by such sub-classification no caste is being included or\n","\n","    excluded from the list of scheduled castes.84. Agreeing with the scholarly separate opinions authored by the\n","\n","     Chief Justice and Brother Gavai, J., I summarise my views as\n","\n","     under:classification of a class particularly scheduled caste as\n","\n","              I would not be suggesting dismantling of an existing\n","\n","              building without erecting a new one in its place which\n","\n","              may prove to be more useful;(ii)   In the Constitutional regime, there is no caste system\n","\n","              and the country has moved into a casteless society52except for the deeming provision under the Constitution\n","\n","        for the limited purposes of affording reservation to the\n","\n","        depressed class of persons, downtrodden or belonging\n","\n","        to SC/ST/OBC. Therefore, any facility or privilege for\n","\n","        the promotion of the above categories of persons has to\n","\n","        be on a totally different criteria other than the caste may\n","\n","        be on economic or financial factors, status of living,\n","\n","        vocation and the facilities available to each one of them\n","\n","        based upon their place of living (urban or rural);(iii)   The reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the\n","\n","        first generation or one generation and if any generation\n","\n","        in the family has taken advantage of the reservation and\n","\n","        have achieved higher status, the benefit of reservation\n","\n","        would   not   be   logically   available   to   the   second\n","\n","        generation; and(iv)    It is reiterated that periodical exercise has to be\n","\n","        undertaken to exclude the class of person who after\n","\n","        taking advantage of reservation has come to march,\n","\n","        shoulder to shoulder with the general category.5385. However, on the question of applicability of the ‘creamy layer\n","principle’ to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, I find myself in\n","agreement with the view expressed by Justice Gavai i.e., for the full\n","realisation of substantive equality inter se the Scheduled Castes and\n","Scheduled Tribes, the identification of the ‘creamy layer’ qua Scheduled\n","Castes and Scheduled Tribes ought to become a constitutional imperative\n","for the State.…………………………………………J.\n","384\n","[-0.09192311, 0.0032143807, 0.0625594, -0.03997266, -0.015242684, 0.051180005, 0.0146277575, -0.005878655,

This is\n","\n","     evident fromArticles 14and15of the Constitution which\n","\n","     provides for equality before law and that State shall not\n","\n","     discriminate on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of\n","\n","     birth.Articles 14and15 (as it originally stood)are quoted\n","\n","     below:12. The objective was of\n","\n","     bringing about political equality only.15. It was followed by theConstitution (Eighty-first Amendment)\n","\n","     Act, 2000which insertedArticle 16(4)(B)so as to make\n","\n","     provisions for carry forward of unfilled vacancies of the reserved\n","\n","     category. The Constitution though aimed at a casteless society, it defined\n","\n","     certain       depressed/disadvantageous      classes      as   Scheduled\n","\n","     Castes and certain tribes living in forest, hilly areas and other\n","\n","     remote areas as Scheduled Tribes. The turmoil so\n","\n","     created by such agitations and demonstrations particularly in\n","\n","     the months of August-November of 1990 is the ample indication\n","\n","     of the wide spread violence.54. ‘A’ being a general category candidate, qualifies for admission\n","\n","    in higher education on merits whereas ‘B’ who belongs to a\n","\n","    backward class competes and qualifies for admission in the\n","\n","    reserved category. CASTELESS SOCIETY-CASTE SYSTEM VIS-À-VIS THE VARNA\n","SYSTEM59. The Constitution virtually visualises a casteless society and a\n","\n","     unified society but in the name of ‘equality’ to accord facility\n","\n","     and privileges to the depressed class/downtrodden, it is said\n","\n","     that we have continued with the so-called Manuwadi System of\n","\n","     caste. I am not an expert of religious scriptures nor do I claim\n","\n","     that I have any knowledge of any one of them though I may have\n","\n","     gone through Bhagwad Gita and Ramcharit Manas some times. This can very well be reflected by verse 13\n","\n","     of chapter 4 and verse 41 of chapter 18 of the Bhagwat Gita\n","\n","     which I quote below.3960. चातुर्वर्ण्व मया सृष्टं गुणकमववर्भागशः । (Chapter 4, Verse 13, Bhagwat Gita)\n","\n","        ब्राह्मणक्षवियवर्शां शूद्राणां च परन्तप।62. The misconstruction of the varna\n","\n","     system as a caste system was a social defect that crept in with\n","\n","     time and was not considered to be good as it divided the society\n","\n","     and brought about discrimination & inequality.68. Each concession once made, just goes on swelling\n","\n","     like a raisin/balloon. If any class is not integrated it can be further classified\n","\n","    and such sub-classification of a class would not be violative ofArticle 14of the Constitution, so long persons in a class are not\n","\n","    similarly situated.

None\n","Clause (2)\n","\n","      of the saidArticle 341states that Parliament may by law include in or\n","\n","      exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes specified in the notification\n","\n","      issued under Clause (1) any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within\n","\n","      any caste, race or tribe, but save as aforesaid a notification issued\n","\n","

(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of\n","scheduled tribes specified in a notification issued by the\n","President under clause (1) of this article any Tribe or Tribal\n","community or part of or group within any Tribe or Tribal\n","community but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the\n","said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.”\n","The object of these two articles, as I stated, was to eliminate the\n","necessity of burdening the Constitution with long lists of\n","Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The only limitation that has been imposed is this\n",": that once a notification has been issued by the President, which,\n","undoubtedly, he will be issuing in consultation with and on the\n","advice of the Government of each State, thereafter, if any\n","elimination was to be made from the List so notified or any\n","addition was to be made, that must be made by Parliament and\n","not by the President. Once the notification is issued under Clause (1) ofArticle 341,\n","\n","    it is only the Parliament which can by law, include in or exclude from the\n","\n","    list of Scheduled Castes specified in the notification, any caste, race or\n","\n","    tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe, and the\n","\n","    notification issued under Clause (1) could not be varied by any\n","\n","    subsequent notification. The only limitation put\n","\n","    was that once a notification has been issued by the President, any\n","\n","    elimination from or any addition in the list must be made by the\n","\n","    Parliament and not by the President. It further held that Clause (2) provides that the\n","\n","    Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of the\n","\n","    Scheduled Castes specified in the notification issued under Clause (1),\n","\n","    any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe. 16 AIR (1965) SC 126942The power was thus given to Parliament to modify the notification made\n","\n","     by the President under Clause (1). A notification issued under Clause\n","\n","     (1) could not be varied by any subsequent notification, thus making the\n","\n","     notification by the President final for all times except for modification by\n","\n","     law as provided by Clause (2).37…………………………………………………….40.

By virtue of theConstitution (One Hundred and Fifth) Amendment Act, 2021, an\n","\n","    explanation to Clause (2) and new Clause (3) have been added to58Article 342(A).The difference between theArticle 341, 342and342Ais\n","\n","    that, whereas the notifications issued underArticle 341and342cannot\n","\n","    be varied except by the Parliament by law, the newly added Clause (3)\n","\n","    ofArticle 342Apermits the State or Union Territory by law, to prepare\n","\n","    and maintain for its own purposes a list of Socially and Educationally\n","\n","    Backward Classes entries which may be different from the Central List.51. The mandate contained in Clause (2) ofArticle 341specifically prohibits\n","\n","    any variation in the notification issued under Clause (1) thereof, except\n","\n","    by Parliament by law. There is no provision in the Constitution which\n","\n","    would empower the States to make any variation in such notification\n","\n","    issued under Clause (1) ofArticle 341, for the purpose of reservations\n","\n","    underArticle 15or 16.

education is being enjoyed,\n","who are doing better hereditary occupation. As transpiring from the extracts of the Constituent Assembly Debates\n","\n","    placed on record, there was no Article similar toArticle 341as found in\n","\n","    the present Constitution. President: Yes.Newarticles 300Aand 300B. President: 218A.Shri T. T. Krishnamachari: In reading it he has included that. Once is\n","205 and the other is 225. Shri Kuladhar Chaliha (Assam: General): Mr. President, I move;\n","“That in amendment No. Whatever Parliament says they are bound by it; but\n","if there is anything which consistently with the orders of the\n","Parliament they can do anything, they should be allowed to have\n","the power. That is why I have moved this. However,\n","the Governor is there—that is an improvement—Parliament, is\n","there and the President is there. President: ‘That is a separate matter. In\n","Madras there were six communities that came under this\n","classification. And in the 1935 Act, the Government\n","thoroughly examined the whole thing and as far as the Province\n","of Madras is concerned they brought 86 communities into this list\n","or category, though there were some touchable classes also. I emphasise this because of late there have been some\n","movements here and there; there are people who have left\n","Scheduled Castes and Hinduism and joined other religions and\n","they also are claiming to be scheduled Castes. However, the term “backward\n","\n","    class” is used inArticle 16(4)only. There is\n","              no doubt that it is an indispensable adjunct to all other powers\n","              and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction and operates as a\n","              valuable weapon in the hands of the Court to prevent “clogging\n","              or obstruction of the stream of justice”. An ideal form of society is one which\n","\n","     progresses on merit or where merit alone prevails. Also, there\n","\n","     was violence in Maharashtra against the Maratha reservation,\n","\n","     to talk about the few.3555. There is no compulsion to give education to such\n","\n","    children. According to my limited understanding of the scriptures\n","\n","     specially the Gita, I am of the firm view that in primitive India\n","\n","     there was no existence of any caste system rather there was\n","\n","     categorisation of the people according to their profession, talent,\n","\n","     qualities and nature. According to the varna system no one is to be considered as\n","\n","     lower or higher, rather it is preached that everyone is equal\n","\n","     fragment and a part and parcel of Him, the Almighty. In short, what is intended to be conveyed is that according to\n","\n","     Gita there is no caste system and the varna system42(categorization) referred to therein is quite distinct, based upon\n","\n","     persons nature & qualities. Thus, there was no caste system in\n","\n","     ancient India i.e., Bharat. In other words, to put it summarily there was no caste system\n","\n","    in primitive India. It is common understanding that what is conceded once to\n","\n","     appease any class cannot be taken back. The reference is accordingly answered and it is held that sub-classification of scheduled castes is permissible in law for the\n","\n","     purposes of reservation.\n","384\n","[-0.030339727,

Supreme Court frowning upon the filing of fresh SLPs .............................. 97\n","     D.6. Public interest and justice ....................................................................... 98\n","     D.7. The GNCTD initiated the land acquisition process under theLand\n","\n","Acquisition Act, 1894(hereinafter, “1894 Act”) for the planned1 MA No. In the meanwhile, the 2013 Act was enacted by the Parliament,\n","\n","thereby repealing the 1894 Act. The appellants were represented by Ld. Substantiating\n","\n","this, they made the following submissions:The discovery of the facts suppressed by the respondents before the\n","\n","     High Court, gives rise to a fresh cause of action and, hence the\n","\n","     period preceding the revelation of such fraud deserves to be\n","\n","     excluded while calculating the limitation period.6. (f)      The grounds of public interest or cause of justice cannot be\n","\n","   invoked to condone the delay, for even if the law of limitation\n","\n","   produces a harsh outcome, it ought to be followed. Since the issue in this batch of appeals concerns the condonation\n","\n","of delay, it would be worthwhile to briefly allude to the law of limitation.The Limitation Act, 1963(“Limitation Act”) is a statute of repose founded\n","\n","on considerations of public policy and expediency. Public interest requires that finality\n","\n","should be put to litigation.The Limitation Act, thus, prescribes the\n","\n","specific points of time from which the period of limitation begins to run\n","\n","for the institution of actions. On expiry of such period, no action can be\n","\n","initiated save and except where the court condones the delay for a\n","\n","sufficient cause. The Bombay High Court inKumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. As is clear from a plain reading ofSection 5of the Limitation Act,\n","\n","there are exceptions to this general rule. While there is no arithmetical formula, through decades of judicial\n","\n","application, certain yardsticks for judging the sufficiency of cause for\n","\n","condonation of delay have evolved. The expression ‘sufficient\n","\n","cause’ should be given liberal construction so as to advance substantial\n","\n","justice.2814. In addition to “sufficient cause”,Section 5also requires that such\n","\n","cause must be shown within the prescribed period. The appellants argued that the respondent-landowners had\n","\n","suppressed material facts from the High Court, including previous\n","\n","unsuccessful litigations. They urged that had\n","\n","these facts been disclosed before the High Court, the respondents would\n","\n","have been estopped from seeking the declaration that the acquisition\n","\n","proceedings had lapsed. These concealments, they submitted, amount to playing fraud\n","\n","on both the court and the public exchequer. Accordingly, the time spent\n","\n","in the discovery of such suppressions should be deducted from the\n","\n","overall quantum of delay.18. In this regard, the appellants have citedSection 17of the\n","\n","Limitation Act, which provides that:19. There can indeed be no quarrel thatSection 17of the Limitation\n","\n","Act is premised on the well-known principle that fraud vitiates the delay\n","\n","and provides a cause of action once discovered. To revisitSection\n","\n","5of the Limitation Act, the text of the statute provides that an appeal\n","\n","or application may be admitted after the prescribed period if the\n","\n","“appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause\n","\n","for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such\n","\n","period”. Hence, the appellants are required to explain that they were\n","\n","diligent during the prescribed period of limitation and could not file the\n","\n","appeal because of a “sufficient cause” arising within the prescribed\n","\n","period.There would be no finality to the proceedings and every time this Court\n","\n","would reach a different conclusion from its previous case, all such cases\n","\n","and the cases relying on it would be reopened.byManoharlal(supra) would not, therefore, be a sufficient ground to\n","\n","argue that the cases should be reopened.forming the very basis of the High Court’s decision stood overruled, the\n","\n","dispute before it must be decided as per the later decision.32. In cases where the limitation would have expired\n","      during the period between 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021,\n","      notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation\n","      remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of\n","      90 days from 15.03.2021. In the event the actual balance\n","      period of limitation remaining, with effect from 15.03.2021, is\n","      greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply.III. The period from 15.03.2020 till 14.03.2021 shall also stand\n","      excluded in computing the periods prescribed underSections\n","      23 (4)and29Aof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,Section 12Aof the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisos(b) and (c) ofSection 138of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n","      1881 and any other laws, which prescribe period(s) of\n","      limitation for instituting proceedings, outer limits\n","      (within which the court or tribunal can condone delay)\n","      and termination of proceeding […]”.on 23.09.2021 when directions to exclude the period between\n","\n","15.03.2020 and 02.10.2021 from limitation were issued.4443. On account of the third wave of Pandemic, the aforementioned\n","\n","order dated 23.09.2021 was finally modified on 10.01.2022, with a total\n","\n","period of approximately 716 days between 15.03.2020-28.02.2022\n","\n","being excluded from the operation of limitation.45D.6. Public interest and justice48. As a final contention, the appellants have sought this Court’s\n","\n","indulgence asserting ‘public interest’ and the ‘larger cause of justice’.Against this, respondents have argued that the delay cannot be\n","\n","condoned merely based on broad assertions of equity.49. In numerous cases, the land has been deployed for essential\n","\n","public projects such as hospitals, schools, expansion of the metro, etc. Hence, the effect of non-condonation of delay would go beyond mere\n","\n","financial loss to the exchequer, and instead extend to the public at\n","\n","large.54. When balancing public with\n","\n","private interest, the quantum and adequacy of compensation do not\n","\n","compel us much. Hence, we believe that the comparative impact on the\n","\n","respondent-landowners would be minimal.55. We also cannot be oblivious to the fact that the multiplicity of\n","\n","contradictory judicial opinions onSection 24(2)of the 2013 Act within\n","\n","a relatively short span of time have made the present set of\n","\n","circumstances sui generis. Hence, the larger interest of justice mandates us to condone the\n","\n","delay in the present batch of cases. We note that the respondents have cited Pundlik Jalam Patil\n","\n","(supra) to argue that public interest cannot be a sole ground to seek\n","\n","condonation of delay. The analysis in the foregoing paragraphs prompts us to hold that\n","\n","while some of the arguments put forth by the government authorities\n","\n","for condonation of delay, like subsequent change of law, special leeway\n","\n","for government entities, or the Court allegedly frowning upon filing of\n","\n","fresh SLPs; cannot be accepted, however, the appellants have made out\n","\n","sufficient cause for condonation of delay on the ground of public\n","\n","interest. Likewise, we have identified the cases enlisted as D.1, which fall\n","\n","within the four corners of our analysis inGNCTD v. BSK Realtors.49\n","\n","Allthese cases are, therefore, disposed of by invoking our powers underArticle 142of the Constitution in terms of the directions issued inBSK\n","\n","Realtors(supra). All these matters have thus been\n","\n","rendered infructuous. We revive the relevant writ\n","\n","petitions, which shall stand restored on the file of the High Court. The Reference Court shall then invest the\n","\n","deposited amount in a short-term interest-bearing fixed deposit account\n","\n","with a nationalized bank, ensuring its periodical renewal until the\n","\n","relevant writ petition is disposed of by the nominated bench. Release of\n","\n","the invested amount together with the accrued interest to the rightful\n","\n","claimant will be contingent upon the decision of the High Court.72. At\n","\n","the same time, we are of the considered view that it would not subserve\n","\n","any public interest at large, given the unique situation at hand, if the\n","\n","government were to be required to fulfill all the conditions for a fresh\n","\n","acquisition under the 2013 Act. As analyzed before under the Head:73. We accordingly issue the following directions for\n","\n","all the cases mentioned in ‘List-E.3’:(f)    The land-owners may submit their objections within a\n","\n","period of four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this\n","\n","Order. The market value of the land shall be assessed\n","\n","as on 01.01.2014 and the compensation shall be awarded along\n","\n","with all other monetary benefits in accordance with the provisions\n","\n","of the 2013 Act except the claim like rehabilitation etc. ;(i)    The Collector shall consider all the parameters prescribed\n","\n","underSection     28of the 2013       Act for    determining the\n","\n","compensation for the acquired land. 14308/2020 (Ashok\n","\n","Pratap Singh v.

None\n","Leeway to be granted to government entities ............................................ 91\n","     D.4. These appeals have been preferred by the Delhi Development\n","\n","Authority (DDA), Government of National Capital of Delhi (GNCTD),63Land    Acquisition   Collector   (LAC),   Delhi   State   Industrial    and\n","\n","Infrastructure    Development     Corporation      (DSIIDC),   East     Delhi\n","\n","Municipal Corporation, and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC)\n","\n","(collectively, the “appellants”), against various identical orders of the\n","\n","High Court of Delhi, whereby acquisition proceedings had been declared\n","\n","to have lapsed in terms ofSection 24(2)of the Right to Fair\n","\n","Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation\n","\n","and Resettlement Act, 2013 (hereinafter, the “2013 Act”). The beneficiaries of such acquisition process were\n","\n","various state entities such as DDA, DSIIDC, and DMRC, who needed\n","\n","the lands for different projects like residential schemes, industrial\n","\n","areas, flyovers, the Delhi Metro, etc. Accordingly, over a long span of\n","\n","1957-2006, various notifications underSections 4and6of the 1894\n","\n","Act were issued for acquiring these lands and awards were passed\n","\n","underSection 11of the 1894 Act affixing compensation.3.3. This new legislation brought about\n","\n","various reforms to the land acquisition process. Importantly,Section 24of the 2013 Act provided that land acquisition proceedings initiated\n","\n","under the earlier regime would be deemed to have lapsed in certain\n","\n","cases, including when compensation had not been paid or possession\n","\n","had not been taken. Hence, at this stage, it is\n","\n","important to first examine at length the prayer for condonation of delay\n","\n","and the maintainability of these petitions, before delving into the merits\n","\n","of each case.4. The appellants argued that they had sufficient cause for not filing\n","\n","the appeals and applications within the prescribed time. A party who is insensible to the value of civil remedies,\n","\n","and who does not assert his claim with promptitude is denied the ability\n","\n","to enforce even an otherwise rightful claim. This position is reflected in\n","\n","the Latin maxim, vigilantibus et non dormientibus jura subveniunt, i.e.,\n","\n","the law aids the vigilant and not those who sleep on their rights.8. Mody24aptly exposited the philosophical pillars supporting the concept\n","\n","of limitation: (i) the sword of prosecution ought not to be hanging over\n","\n","an individual for an indeterminate period; (ii) those who have been\n","\n","lethargic in safeguarding their interests should not expect the law to\n","\n","come to their rescue; and (iii) a defendant ought not to suffer for lost\n","\n","evidence owing to the passage of time.9.Section 3of the Limitation Act reflects this philosophy. Every suit\n","\n","or appeal made after the period of limitation ought to be dismissed,\n","\n","notwithstanding whether such ground had been raised by the opposite\n","\n","side. The statute allows for\n","\n","admitting an action provided “sufficient cause” is shown. This vests\n","\n","courts with the discretion to extend the period of limitation if the\n","\n","applicant can show that he had sufficient cause for not preferring an\n","\n","appeal or application within the prescribed period.Section 5requires\n","\n","analysis of two ingredients: first, an examination of whether “sufficient\n","\n","\n","24Kumudini Ramdas Shah v. K.M. Mody & Ors., AIR 1985 Bombay 320, para 4.cause” has been made out; and second, whether such cause has been\n","\n","shown for not filing the appeal/application “within the prescribed\n","\n","period”.11. As regards the first ingredient, theLimitation Actitself does not\n","\n","provide more guidance on what its constituent elements ought to be.12. Mere good cause is not sufficient\n","\n","enough to turn back the clock and allow resuscitation of a claim\n","\n","otherwise barred by delay. The court ought to be cautious while\n","\n","undertaking such an exercise, being circumspect against condoning\n","\n","delay which is attributable to the applicant.25 Although the actual\n","\n","period of delay might be instructive, it is the explanation for the delay\n","\n","which would be the decisive factor. To satisfy the latter\n","\n","condition, the applicant must show sufficient cause for not filing the\n","\n","appeal/application on the last day of the prescribed period and explain\n","\n","the delay made thereafter.29 Causes arising after the culmination of the\n","\n","limitation period, despite being sufficient in substance, would not\n","\n","suffice for condonation given this second prong ofSection 5of the\n","\n","Limitation Act. However, the applicant shall not be required to prove\n","\n","each day’s delay till the date of filing such appeal/application.3015. Other\n","\n","respondent-landowners also concealed from the court how they were\n","\n","only subsequent purchasers who had acquired the lands after they had\n","\n","been notified for the acquisition. In addition to highlighting the factum of suppression, the\n","\n","appellants have also demonstrated materiality. The appellants have in this regard placed\n","\n","reliance onMeera Sahni v. Lt. Governor of Delhi31 andSection 3of\n","\n","Delhi Lands (Restrictions on Transfer) Act, 1972, to fortify their\n","\n","contention that no bona fide sale transaction could take place in respect\n","\n","\n","\n","31 (2008) 9 SCC 177, para 21.of the lands which were already the subject matter of acquisition\n","\n","process. 32 The appellants’\n","\n","contention, however, has to be evaluated keeping in view the stand\n","\n","taken on behalf of the respondent-landowners who have refuted the\n","\n","omnibus allegation of suppression of facts against all of them. We may also hasten to clarify the scope of our enquiry. The\n","\n","respondent-landowners have not been called upon to refute or admit\n","\n","the allegations of concealment of facts attributed to some of them.Similarly, we have not asked the appellants to produce original records\n","\n","and documents to substantiate their allegation of concealment and\n","\n","suppression of material facts. We are conscious that entering into an\n","\n","arena of factual controversy at such an advanced stage of litigation, and\n","\n","that too without giving adequate opportunities to the parties can be a\n","\n","potential threat to the cause of justice. Firstly, this ground seeks to use events temporally subsequent to\n","\n","the expiry of the limitation period to justify the delay. To say it differently, if a case has already been\n","\n","decided, it cannot be re-opened and re-decided solely on the basis of a\n","\n","new interpretation given to that law.33. The appellants have vehemently contended that the government\n","\n","entities ought to be allowed leeway for condonation of delay. Ramegowda(supra) which held that courts ought to be generous while\n","\n","considering delay on the part of government entities given factors\n","\n","unique to them like the impersonal nature of their functioning,\n","\n","inherited bureaucratic methodology, and procedural red-tapeism.individual officers had acted with mala fide, chose not to extend the\n","\n","burden of individual recklessness to the State’s institutional interest;as may be seen from the following extract:40. The fourth ground taken by the appellants is that the delay ought\n","\n","to be condoned on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this juncture,\n","\n","it would be apposite to discuss the series of orders passed by this Court\n","\n","regarding the operation of limitation vis-à-vis the COVID-19 pandemic.II. We agree in principle with the respondents to the extent that\n","\n","deliberate, reckless or negligent delays ought not to be condoned, even\n","\n","if counterweighed by public interest since it may unfairly affect third-party rights that may have vested during the period of lapse. Although at first glance it might appear that this Court is merely\n","\n","tasked with balancing the interests of the public exchequer against that\n","\n","of individual respondents, however, a deeper examination would reveal\n","\n","that there are many other interests at stake and it might not be possible98to undo the acquisitions without causing significant cascading harms\n","\n","and losses to public infrastructure.Additionally, development projects have also begun on many of such\n","\n","lands. Furthermore, even if we were to settle the lis by not condoning\n","\n","delay, it is unlikely that the respondent-landowners would be able to\n","\n","keep their lands as the appellants are empowered under law to initiate\n","\n","acquisition proceedings afresh. The impact of not condoning the delay would thus be three-fold,\n","\n","which taken altogether make a compelling case for condonation of\n","\n","delay: one, there will be significant harm to the public at large by way\n","\n","of delayed infrastructure, in addition to financial loss to the public\n","\n","exchequer; second, the comparative benefit to landowners would not be\n","\n","substantial given that no indefeasible rights have been vested with them\n","\n","as the lis has not yet acquired quietus in most cases; and third, the\n","\n","matter would still not attain finality as the State is likely to invoke its\n","\n","power of eminent domain and reinitiate acquisition proceedings given\n","\n","the criticality of the infrastructure being built. We do not feel that these\n","\n","consequences further the ends of limitation law. A closer examination of the aforementioned case,\n","\n","however, would show that the Court in that case denied condonation of\n","\n","delay as the government had been found to be negligent and given that\n","\n","it had been established that the landowners depended on the acquired\n","\n","lands for their livelihood. While it may not be feasible to give104detailed analysis of each of these cases, suffice it would be to show the\n","\n","same illustratively.For instance, in SLP (C) Diary No. 19172/2019,\n","\n","titled“DDA v. Vijay Mohan”, while the possession was admittedly not\n","\n","taken, compensation was paid on 09.08.2005.Accordingly, the testlaid\n","\n","down inManoharlal(supra) has been met and the acquisition\n","\n","proceedings cannot be deemed to have lapsed under the 2013 Act.66. This\n","\n","will, however, not preclude the respondents from recovery of the\n","\n","compensation amount, if not already paid or to the extent it is not paid,\n","\n","along with interest and other statutory benefits under 1894 Act.Similarly, they shall be at liberty to seek reference underSection 18of\n","\n","the 1894 Act in accordance with law. The Government of NCT of Delhi\n","\n","and its authorities are directed to take physical possession of the lands\n","\n","falling under this category (i.e., ‘List-E.2’), if not already taken and\n","\n","continue uninterruptedly to complete the public infrastructure projects.67. Accordingly, these\n","\n","cases are also de-tagged and ordered to be listed separately on\n","\n","22.07.2024.68. The nominated bench will\n","\n","accord an opportunity to the landowners/subsequent purchasers and\n","\n","the appellants herein to submit additional documents on affidavits\n","\n","whereupon such bench shall embark on an exercise to decide who\n","\n","between the landowner(s) and the subsequent purchaser(s) is the\n","\n","rightful claimant to receive compensation. The nominated bench will\n","\n","have the authority to obtain independent fact-finding enquiry reports,\n","\n","if deemed necessary. The inquiry could include determination as to\n","\n","whether after the notification underSection 4(1)of the 1894 Act, any\n","\n","transfer could have been effected and if so, whether such transfer is\n","\n","permitted by law. To prevent such an outcome and after considering the unique\n","\n","facts and circumstances of this batch of cases, we deem it fit to exercise\n","\n","our powers underArticle 142of the Constitution in the interests of\n","\n","doing complete justice. Such objections shall not question the legality of the\n","\n","acquisition process and shall be limited only to clauses (a) and (b)\n","\n","ofSection 15(1)of the 2013 Act;(g)    The Collector shall publish a public notice on his website\n","\n","and also in one English and one vernacular newspaper, within\n","\n","two weeks of expiry of the period granted under direction (f) above,\n","\n","so as to accord personal hearing to all the persons interested in\n","\n","the land under acquisition in terms ofSection 21(1)of the 2013\n","\n","Act. Such hearing shall also be restricted only to the nature of\n","\n","objections as per direction (f) above and/or the determination of\n","\n","compensation for the acquired land;(h)    The Collector shall, thereafter, pass an award as early as\n","\n","possible but not exceeding six months, regardless of the\n","\n","maximum period of twelve months contemplated underSection\n","\n","25of the 2013 Act. Before parting, we deem it appropriate to provide a cautionary\n","\n","note that the limited fact-finding conducted by this Court may not be\n","\n","entirely accurate due to the complex nature of cases involving\n","\n","subsequent sale transactions, earlier rounds of litigation, land titles,\n","\n","and status of compensation and/or possession.\n","384\n","[-0.046011113, 0.0072719534,

................................................................................................................. 64\n","B.      Contentions of parties ........................................................................................ 72\n","C.      Law on Condonation of Delay............................................................................ 78\n","D.      Whether delay should be condoned in the present cases? The provision reads as follows:3 The contingencies being, when landowners do not give consent to receive\n","compensation, there is no person competent to alienate the land, or there is dispute\n","regarding title to receive the compensation.3.6. To simplify, the present batch of matters before us can broadly\n","\n","be classified into the following three categories:3.15. We note that a factor common to most of the matters mentioned\n","\n","in paragraph 3.14 above is that they were filed after the expiration of\n","\n","the period of limitation. The quantum of delay differs in each case, and\n","\n","while it is less in the cases filed in the first category, it is significantly\n","\n","long in the second and third categories. Per contra, the respondent-land owners vociferously argued that\n","\n","the appellants have failed to showcase sufficient cause in filing the\n","\n","appeals and applications with enormous delay and that:these were only a handful of instances that could not be used for\n","\n","   condoning delay in all the appeals and applications. The respondents\n","\n","   have buttressed this plea by citing Pundlik Jalam Patil v.such parties if the delay is condoned and the settled position is\n","\n","     reversed.7. The dominant\n","\n","objective underlying the law of limitation is that the title to property,\n","\n","and matters of rights in general, cannot be kept in a state of constant\n","\n","uncertainty, doubt or suspense. Instead, it only extinguishes the ability to enforce the right,\n","\n","without either creating or destroying the underlying cause of action or\n","\n","entitlement itself.10. 26technicalities,27 as one motivation underlying such rules is to prevent\n","\n","parties from using dilatory tactics or abusing the judicial process.Pragmatism over pedanticism is therefore sometimes necessary –\n","\n","despite it appearing liberal or magnanimous. With these broad yardsticks in mind, we shall now separately\n","\n","analyze each ground pleaded by the appellants on the anvil of\n","\n","sufficiency.16. Similarly, in some cases, the\n","\n","landowners suppressed the fact that the acquired lands had already\n","\n","vested in their respective Gaon Sabhas.17. We have\n","\n","already noticed in paragraph 6(a) above that according to the\n","\n","respondent-landowners there are only a few cases where the allegation\n","\n","of suppression of material facts merits consideration.20. Simultaneously, we are satisfied\n","\n","that the appellants’ contention in this regard cannot be brushed aside\n","\n","lightly.21. Without expressing any final definitive opinion on such allegations\n","\n","of concealment, we are of the considered view that the appellants have\n","\n","discharged a prima facie burden for the limited purpose of making out\n","\n","a case for condonation of delay in the cases mentioned in the appended\n","\n","‘List-A’, which shall be read as a part of this judgment. We believe that\n","\n","a fact-finding exercise is necessary in these cases, and hence, there\n","\n","exist sufficient grounds for the condonation of delay. The nature of relief\n","\n","to be eventually granted after condoning the delay, will be separately\n","\n","dealt with in Part E of this order.D.2. To sum up, we hold that subsequent change of law will not be\n","\n","attracted unless a case is pending before the competent court awaiting\n","\n","its final adjudication. Although there might be a difference in\n","\n","the quantum of compensation owed to the respondent-landowners, it\n","\n","would come at the expense of delaying the construction of critical public\n","\n","infrastructure in our national capital. The constant flux in the legal position of law\n","\n","undoubtedly created significant challenges for the appellants while\n","\n","approaching this Court, none of which we can ignore outrightly. In\n","\n","addition, we would also reiterate at this juncture that we have found no\n","\n","mala fide on part of the appellants or their officers.56. As discussed earlier in\n","\n","paragraph 13, the law of limitation is intended to curb the evil of\n","\n","deliberate or negligent laxity in legal proceedings, which is not the case\n","\n","here. The consequential relief, after\n","\n","condonation of delay, is however dealt with in Part E (infra) below.58. As discussed above, that is not the case here,\n","\n","especially in the case of landowners in NCT of Delhi, which is almost\n","\n","entirely urban and whose residents generally do not depend on the\n","\n","agricultural income as the source of their livelihood.D.7. Delay already condoned in some casesAgainst these, the respondents have argued that such condonation was\n","\n","done by ex-parte orders.60. The proviso to Rule 9(1) of Order XXI of the Supreme Court Rules,\n","\n","2013 reads:in the annexed ‘List-B’, are therefore ordered to be de-tagged and be\n","\n","listed separately on 22.07.2024.64. In addition, the cases where allegations of suppression of\n","\n","material facts have been made also cannot be rejected at the threshold.65. Having condoned the delay and upon grant of leave and after\n","\n","perusing the material on record, we find that the cases which form part\n","\n","of the appended ‘List-E.2’ are squarely covered in favor of the appellants\n","\n","in terms ofManoharlal(supra). All such civil appeals are accordingly allowed, the impugned\n","\n","judgment of the High Court in each case is set aside, and the acquisition\n","\n","of the respondents’ lands under 1894 Act is consequently upheld. Similarly, we find on perusal of the record that the cases which\n","\n","we have included in the appended ‘List-C.1’ are covered by the ratio of\n","\n","KL Rathi (supra) and are disposed of accordingly. On the same analogy, there are cases included in\n","\n","‘List-D.2’, where the impugned judgements have been already set aside\n","\n","in the previous rounds of litigation. At this stage, we may hasten to add that the cases mentioned in\n","\n","the appended ‘List-A’ contain allegations of fraud against the\n","\n","landowners. As discussed in paragraph 21, given that a detailed fact-finding inquiry is necessary to ascertain the rightful title-holder and the49 SLP(C) Diary No. 17623/2021.106claimant of receiving the compensation, we hereby set aside the orders\n","\n","of the High Court that are under challenge in these civil appeals or in\n","\n","the civil appeals out of which the subject Review Petitions or\n","\n","Miscellaneous Applications have arisen. After\n","\n","deciding the question of suppression of facts, the High Court shall\n","\n","proceed to dispose of the cases on merits, in terms of our dictum in\n","\n","these batch of cases.71. In this regard, the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the High Court of Delhi\n","\n","is requested to constitute a dedicated bench to decide these writ\n","\n","petitions in the manner indicated hereafter. Once compensation is determined, the relevant\n","\n","authority in the land acquisition department shall deposit the same107with the Reference Court. Lastly, we find that there are some cases which are included in\n","\n","‘List-E.3’ where the appellants not only failed to take possession of the\n","\n","acquired land but also did not pay any compensation. Consequently,\n","\n","the appellants cannot seek protection underManoharlal(supra). Similarly, the Collector shall\n","\n","determine the market value of the building or assets attached with\n","\n","the land in accordance withSection 29of the 2013 Act, and shall\n","\n","further award solatium in accordance withSection 30of the 2013\n","\n","Act;(j)    In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, since\n","\n","      it is difficult to reverse the clock back, the compliance of Chapter\n","\n","      (V) pertaining to “Rehabilitation and Resettlement Award” is\n","\n","      hereby dispensed with; and(k)    The expropriated land-owners shall be entitled to seek\n","\n","      reference for enhancement of compensation in accordance with\n","\n","      Chapter-VIII of the 2013 Act.74. Finally, apart from the aforementioned segregation of cases, the\n","\n","present batch of matters also includes SLP(C) No. We accordingly grant\n","\n","liberty to the parties to approach the High Court if any factual disputes\n","\n","arise in future or if further clarification is required, and the High Court\n","\n","shall decide such cases based on the principles outlined above, taking\n","\n","into account the facts and, if necessary, the merits of the case.77. All the matters stand disposed of in aforementioned terms.the present SLP.List E.2   No previous SLP or The acquisition under\n","                            leave not granted in 1894 Act upheld.5.DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY vs. NEERAJ JAIN [R.P]- [D.
